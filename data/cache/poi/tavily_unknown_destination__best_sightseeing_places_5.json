      "content": "If castles are your thing, Prague has an absolute beauty: a 1000-year-old fortress covering around 7 hectares (17 acres) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest ancient castle complex. The Old Town is where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find many of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quintessential attractions, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be rewarded for exploring other intriguing neighborhoods \u00e2\u0081 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which also happen to be where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find many of the city's best restaurants.\n\n## 8. Vienna, Austria [...] ## 6. Dubrovnik, Croatia\n\nDubrovnik's main claim to fame is its historic city wall, considered among the grandest in the world, which surrounds luminous marble streets and finely ornamented buildings. Built between the 13th and 16th centuries, the walls are still remarkably intact, and the vistas over the terracotta rooftops and the Adriatic Sea are sublime, especially at dusk, when the fading light makes the hues dramatic and the panoramas unforgettable. [...] ## 31. Bruges, Belgium\n\nIf you set out to design a fairy-tale medieval town, it would be hard to improve on central Bruges (Brugge in Dutch). Picturesque cobbled lanes and dreamy canals link photogenic squares lined with soaring towers, historical churches and photogenic whitewashed almshouses.",

Kiev.Victor/Shutterstock\n\nThere is simply no way you could tour [Europe](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/europe) and not be awestruck by its natural beauty, fascinating history, rich culture, fabulous food, world-changing art and dazzling diversity. From sun-kissed\u00a0[islands](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-islands-in-europe) to [secret corners](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/europe-off-the-beaten-path), there's always somewhere new to discover.\n\nEurope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealth of attractions is its biggest single draw. Who hasn't dreamed of seeing Florence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Renaissance art, Venice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s graceful canals, Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Napoleonic splendor, and the multilayered historical and cultural canvas of London? And spring adds an extra layer of magic to many of Europe's greatest cities as trees and flowers blossom and outdoor exploration gets a bit easier.\u00a0\n\nOutdoors types will be spoiled for choice in Europe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the continent is blessed with a dizzying diversity of natural scenery, from rugged Scottish Highlands dotted with glens and lochs and the snow-capped mountains of the Alps to the flower fields and hilltop villages of Provence and the island-speckled coastlines of the Adriatic and Aegean. And those are just a few of the highlights.\n\nSome of Europe's most popular spots have felt the [effects of tourism](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/spanish-cities-new-rules-party-tourism-stag-hen-bachelor) in recent years, as increasing visitor numbers have impacted local populations, services and historic sites.\u00a0But with some smart decision-making and forward planning, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in for the journey of a lifetime. Here are 34 of the best places to visit in Europe in 2025.\n\n## 1. London, UK\n\n[London](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/london) is mercurial and endlessly fascinating. You could spend a lifetime getting to know it, then realize the city has gone and changed again. Stretching back from the mighty River Thames, its lush parks and historic districts are crammed with extraordinary sights \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from royal palaces and towering cathedrals to remarkable museums and galleries. Add some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top theaters, [restaurants](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/local-recommends-best-places-eat-drink-east-london), sports venues and shops, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be very reluctant to leave.\n\nTravelers who want to dive deeper into London will be rewarded by exploring its [varied and characterful neighborhoods](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighborhoods-in-london), taking in the cool clubs of Shoreditch or the picturesque streets of Notting Hill. With more time, tack on a [day trip](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/day-trips-from-london) to explore nature in the New Forest, admire the Roman ruins of [Bath](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/southwest-england/bath), or soak up the creativity of [Brighton](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/southeast-england/brighton-and-hove).\n\n![Venice canal view with historical buildings](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/shutterstock1917041357.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 2. Venice, Italy\n\nA bright winter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day, with crisp sunshine and far fewer tourists around, is the perfect time to lap up [Venice](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/venice)'s unique and magical atmosphere. Ditch your map and wander the shadowy back lanes of Dorsoduro while imagining secret assignations and whispered conspiracies at every turn. Then visit two of Venice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top galleries, the [Gallerie dell\u00e2\u0080\u0099Accademia](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/venice/sestiere-di-dorsoduro/attractions/gallerie-dell-accademia/a/poi-sig/399885/1320996) and the [Peggy Guggenheim Collection](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/venice/sestiere-di-dorsoduro/attractions/peggy-guggenheim-collection/a/poi-sig/399959/1320996), which house works by many giants of Italian and European art.\n\nIn recent years, Venice has struggled under the pressures of mass tourism, and visitors should brush up on [how to be mindful while traveling](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/things-to-know-before-traveling-to-venice) in this gorgeous but fragile city. A [new entry fee](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/venice-introduces-new-booking-system-and-entry-fee-for-visitors) for day-trippers may inspire people to stay longer, which is one way to get a deeper understanding of this incredible city.\n\n## 3. Paris, France\n\nDesigned as a temporary exhibit for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World Fair), the elegant, iconic [Eiffel Tower](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/paris/eiffel-tower-16e-and-la-defense/attractions/eiffel-tower/a/poi-sig/372147/1322674) has become the defining fixture of the [Paris](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/paris) skyline. In fact, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine a city more iconic than the City of Light. From [legendary culinary offerings](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/local-recommends-best-places-eat-drink-paris) and [alluring nightlife](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/paris-after-dark-nightlife) to a seemingly endless selection of [museums, galleries and flea markets](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-in-paris), Paris is a travel dream made real.\n\nSpend your days wandering through the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 20 [intriguing arrondissements (districts)](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-paris-arrondissements), or head further afield on a [day trip](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/the-best-day-trips-from-paris) to Monet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s garden at [Giverny](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/giverny) or Marie Antoinette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former home at [Versailles](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/versailles). Whatever you do, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a trip to remember.\n\n![View of old cozy street in Rome, Italy.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/shutterstock520976350.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 4. Rome, Italy\n\nFrom the crumbling [Colosseum](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/ancient-rome/attractions/colosseum/a/poi-sig/1160430/1321271) to the ancient [Forum](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/ancient-rome/attractions/roman-forum/a/poi-sig/389047/1321271) and the timeless [Via Appia Antica](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/southern-rome/attractions/via-appia-antica/a/poi-sig/1255089/1321009), few sights are more evocative than the ruins of ancient [Rome](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome). Two thousand years ago, this city was the center of the greatest empire of the ancient world, where gladiators battled and emperors lived in unimaginable luxury. Nowadays, its ancient sites have a haunting mystery; as you walk the cobbled paths, you can almost sense the ghosts in the air.\n\nBut don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contemporary side. Shop for hip handbags or handmade jewelry in [Rome\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coolest independent boutiques](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/rome-best-independent-shops). Rub shoulders with locals over *aperitivo* (pre-meal drinks) at trendy bars or check out the street art in [neighborhoods such as Ostiense and San Lorenzo](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighborhoods-in-rome). In a city that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been around for thousands of years, there are always plenty of new treasures to find.\n\n## 5. Berlin, Germany\n\nNearly 35 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe that this most cosmopolitan of cities once marked one of the key frontiers in the Cold War. But reminders of [Berlin](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/berlin)'s divided past remain. Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re passing the [Brandenburg Gate](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/berlin/historic-mitte/attractions/brandenburger-tor/a/poi-sig/1265977/1320673), gazing at graffiti-covered sections of the old Berlin Wall at [East Side Gallery](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/berlin/friedrichshain/attractions/east-side-gallery/a/poi-sig/1104617/1320681) or studying the exhibits at the [DDR Museum](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/germany/berline/mitte-scheunenviertel/attractions/ddr-museum/a/poi-sig/372923/1320672), it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an essential part of understanding the forces that have shaped Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital. From the past to the future \u00e2\u0080\u0093 be sure to soak up the city's amazing modern touches, like its [iconic club culture](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/berlin-new-club-opening-culture-techno), [unique independent shops](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-independent-shops-berlin) and [cool neighborhoods](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighborhoods-in-berlin).\n\n## 6. Dubrovnik, Croatia\n\n[Dubrovnik](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/dubrovnik)'s main claim to fame is its [historic city wall](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/dubrovnik/attractions/city-walls-forts/a/poi-sig/1192927/358783), considered among the grandest in the world, which surrounds luminous marble streets and finely ornamented buildings. Built between the 13th and 16th centuries, the walls are still remarkably intact, and the vistas over the terracotta rooftops and the Adriatic Sea are sublime, especially at dusk, when the fading light makes the hues dramatic and the panoramas unforgettable.\n\nThe city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prominent role in the TV series Game of Thrones has caused a massive surge in visitors \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and in the number of tours taking people to all the starring spots. But travelers can still get to know the real Dubrovnik by [diving deeper into its top attractions](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/top-things-to-do-in-dubrovnik) and [wandering outside of the Old Town.](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighborhoods-in-dubrovnik)\n\n![Tourists wander the old square of central Prague, dominated by a twin-spired church](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-05/Prague-Old-Town.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 7. Prague, Czechia\n\nThe capital of [Czechia](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/czech-republic) (formerly Czech Republic), [Prague](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/czech-republic/prague) is one of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most alluring and dynamic cities. For all its modern verve, some parts of town have hardly changed since medieval times. Cobbled cul-de-sacs twist and turn, framed by teetering townhouses, baroque buildings and graceful bridges.\n\nIf castles are your thing, Prague has an absolute beauty: [a 1000-year-old fortress](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/czech-republic/prague/prague-castle-and-hradcany/attractions/prague-castle/a/poi-sig/1019293/1323267) covering around 7 hectares (17 acres) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest ancient castle complex. The Old Town is where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find [many of the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quintessential attractions](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-in-prague), but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be rewarded for [exploring other intriguing neighborhoods](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighborhoods-in-prague) \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 which also happen to be where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find [many of the city's best restaurants](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/local-flavor-where-to-eat-and-drink-in-prague).\n\n## 8. Vienna, Austria\n\nThe monumentally graceful [Hofburg](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/vienna/the-hofburg-around/attractions/hofburg/a/poi-sig/1111646/1334248) palace whisks you back to the age of empires in [Vienna](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/vienna). You can marvel at the treasury\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imperial crowns, the equine ballet of the Spanish Riding School and chandelier-lit apartments once occupied by Emperor Franz Joseph I and Empress Elisabeth. The palace, a legacy of the 640-year-long Habsburg Empire, is rivaled in grandeur only by the 1441-room [Schloss Scho\u00cc\u0088nbrunn](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/vienna/schloss-schonbrunn-around/attractions/schloss-schoenbrunn/a/poi-sig/1279627/1334255), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the baroque [Schloss Belvedere](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/vienna/schloss-belvedere-to-the-canal/attractions/schloss-belvedere/a/poi-sig/1111671/1334253), both set in exquisite gardens.\n\n![The Garden at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam with spring tulips blooming.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/Shutterstock519510310.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 9. Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nTo say residents of [Amsterdam](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/amsterdam) love the water is an understatement. Take a stroll beside the canals and check out the thousands of houseboats, or take a canal boat ride, and you'll soon understand why. From the water, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice a whole new set of architectural details, such as the ornamentation bedecking the city's famous bridges. Each time you pass an appealing canalside cafe terrace, mark the location for a later return.\n\n[Getting around in Amsterdam](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/getting-around-amsterdam) is a breeze, making it an ideal city for exploring [hip neighborhoods](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighbourhoods-in-amsterdam) in search of [the best things to eat and drink](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/local-flavor-where-to-eat-and-drink-amsterdam). While there's always [plenty to do in Amsterdam](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-in-amsterdam), sometimes the best experiences come from slowing down, skipping the tourist sights, and soaking up the city vibe.\n\n## 10. Budapest, Hungary\n\nAlong both sides of the romantic Danube River, with the Buda Hills to the west and the start of the Great Plain to the east, [Budapest](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/hungary/budapest) is perhaps the most beautiful city in Eastern Europe. Parks brim with attractions, the architecture is second to none, museums are filled with treasures, pleasure boats sail up and down the scenic Danube Bend, Baroque and Turkish-era [thermal baths](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/a-guide-to-budapests-thermal-baths) billow steam and the city's nightlife throbs till dawn.\n\n![A young girl rollerblading along the Barceloneta beach in Barcelona](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/shutterstock2392517083.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 11. Barcelona, Spain\n\n[Barcelona](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/barcelona) is famous for its Modernista architecture, including the iconic buildings of Antoni Gaudi\u00cc\u0081. His masterpiece is the mighty cathedral [La Sagrada Fami\u00cc\u0081lia](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/barcelona/leixample/attractions/la-sagrada-familia/a/poi-sig/374867/1320680), which remains a work in progress close to a century after its creator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bizarre combination of crazy and classic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Gothic touches intersect with eccentric experimental flourishes and improbable angles. Even half-completed, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a modern-day wonder.\n\nOf course, there's much more to the Catalonian capital than its most famous church. Barcelona heaves with [tapas restaurants, art museums and history-steeped neighborhoods](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-in-barcelona) \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 not to mention [its incredible beaches](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-beaches-near-barcelona-train). The city has been in the spotlight due to the high visitor numbers and the impact on local communities, so make sure you [understand the issues](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/things-to-know-before-traveling-to-barcelona) before you go.\n\n## 12.

Across the city, world-class museums and galleries inform and provoke, serving up everything from glittering Viking treasures and an ill-fated warship, to ABBA props and subversive contemporary art.\n\nThe result is a stimulating, inspiring hub, where the past, present and future constantly merge, converse and interplay.

Throw in [delightful food and vibrant modern culture](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-to-tallinn) and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no wonder Tallinn sometimes seems in danger of being loved to death, especially when the cruise ships dock.\n\nBut this is one of those blessed places that seems to cope with all the attention. Tallinn safeguards the fairy-tale charms of its UNESCO-listed Old Town \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite some exuberant post-Soviet development, the city clearly realizes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to be classy than brassy.

Bruges, Belgium\n\nIf you set out to design a fairy-tale medieval town, it would be hard to improve on central [Bruges](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/belgium/flanders/bruges) (Brugge in Dutch).

If you can stand the cold, come midweek in the depths of winter (except at Christmas time) to avoid the crowds. And do stay overnight to enjoy the views at night, when the city is lit up by atmospheric floodlighting.\n\n## 32. Lapland, Finland\n\n[Lapland](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/finland/lapland) casts a powerful spell \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something intangible fills this land of islands and forests with Arctic magic.

All of the great architectural styles \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, baroque and art nouveau \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are represented here, all thanks to Krak\u00c3\u00b3w surviving WWII largely intact. Whatever your passion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an opera lover, a jazz aficionado, a gourmet or a beer buff \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it here.\n\n![People crowd on a beach and swim in the sea with a whitewashed city in the background](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-08/Lecce-Puglia-Italy-Martina-de-Pascali-MTN02953.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## When is the best season to visit Europe?\n\nEurope is a big place, spanning many different kinds of terrain \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the best time to visit will vary based on the countries you want to see, and your tolerance for heat, cold, and crowds.\n\n### Visiting Europe in summer\n\nJuly and August are undoubtedly the busiest months in Europe, particularly in the most visited countries such as France, Italy, Spain and Greece. In recent years, Mediterranean regions have faced extreme heat and wildfires in the summer months, with popular attractions such as the Acropolis in Athens closing to tourists due to dangerously high temperatures.\n\nIn [France](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france), the south heaves with visitors in the summer, but [locals head out on their own summer vacations](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-time-to-visit-france) and many businesses around the country close in August, [even in Paris](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-time-to-visit-paris).\n\nSummer can be a great time to visit some of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cooler, northern regions, such as Scandinavia, where long days and warm temperatures make this a great time for outdoor pursuits \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the midnight sun means you can enjoy bright evenings out that last well into the next morning. Across the continent, accommodation prices will be at their highest in summer, and booking well in advance is recommended.\n\n### Visiting Europe in spring and autumn\n\nThe spring (from April to May) and early autumn (September and October) are both great times to visit Europe, though spring school holidays and Easter vacations can bring crowds, closures and disruptions in many places. Crowds and prices will be smaller than in mid-summer, though destinations such as Italy remain busy throughout the year. Luckily, there are plenty of destinations in Europe that are perfectly suited for an [autumn escape](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/where-to-go-in-europe-in-fall) or [spring break](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-spring-break-destinations-in-europe).\n\n### Visiting Europe in winter\n\nDuring the winter months, ski resorts throughout the Alps and other European mountain ranges flood with alpine enthusiasts, and shoppers crowd Christmas markets in major cities, but the cold season can bring closures in spots that depend on summer tourism, including some Greek islands. For a dose of [winter sun](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/european-destinations-winter-sun), many European travelers look to sun-warmed islands such as the [Balearics](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/balearic-islands-spain-adventures), the [Canaries](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canary-islands) and [Malta](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/malta).\n\n![Mountains and freeriders at Aiguille du Midi in the French Alps](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2023-05/shutterstockRF258732011.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## Can I visit multiple countries in Europe during my trip?\n\nWith its many land borders, Europe was made for country-hopping \u00e2\u0081\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093 just ask the generations of backpackers and [Interrailers](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-to-interrail-pass-europe) who have meandered across it by road, rail and bicycle. How much of Europe you can see in one trip comes down to how much time you have and how packed you want your itinerary to be.\n\nContinental Europe is [well-connected by rail,](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-train-journeys-europe) and [a resurgence of night trains](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/europe-top-train-routes-2024) is making it even easier to get around without the carbon footprint of flying. Travelers can also [take the Eurostar](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/first-time-travel-eurostar-train) train from continental Europe to [Great Britain](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/great-britain) - much less hassle than traveling by plane!\n\nHowever, be aware of the immigration restrictions that apply to the Schengen Area, which includes most of the countries in continental Europe. If you need to apply for a [Schengen Visa,](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen-borders-and-visa/visa-policy/applying-schengen-visa_en) you'll be able to visit multiple European nations within the Schengen Area, but only for a maximum of 90 days within any 180-day period. If you're lucky enough to have a passport from a European Union country, you can travel freely across Europe with few restrictions.\n\nPlan with a local\n\nTake your travels to the next level\n\nLet a local expert craft your dream trip.\n\n![](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/public/2023-08/article-cover.png?auto=format&q=75&fit=crop&w=864&h=550)\n![](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/public/2023-08/GettyImages-1472610676.jpg?auto=format&q=75&fit=crop&w=864&h=550)\n\nFor Explorers Everywhere\n\n### Follow us\n\n### SUBSCRIBE\n\n### Get 20% off your first order.\n\nSubscribe to Lonely Planet newsletters and promotions.

The country\u2019s sheer variety. The biggest challenge for anyone planning a trip to the USA? Deciding where to begin.\n\nThis continent-size country contains an incredible number of landscapes, cities, cultures and seasonal highlights that would take a lifetime to take in. On any given visit, you could go wandering through skyscraping redwood trees to breathing in deep gulps of sea air on glimmering beaches to immersing yourself in the underground art scenes of some of the world\u2019s most dynamic cities.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a nature lover looking for wide open-spaces and snow-covered peaks or a culture fiend who can\u2019t get enough of museums, galleries and restaurants, the United States has something for you.

New York, New York\n---------------------\n\n**Best place for art and architecture**\n\n Advertisement \n\nA city that looms large in American lore, [New York](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-york-city) continues to live up to the hype. A global center for art, fashion, finance, music and food, the Big Apple will never leave you feeling bored. Sip sunset [cocktails on luxurious rooftops](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-rooftop-bars-in-new-york-city), mosh at local punk shows, marvel at world-class art in [famous museums](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-museums-in-new-york), or indulge in [the best food you\u2019ve ever had](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/local-flavor-where-to-eat-and-drink-manhattan) at a hole-in-the-wall favorite.\n\n**Planning tip:**New York has [an almost endless amount to offer](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-nyc)\u2013 but resist the urge to see it all on your first trip. Break things down [by neighborhood, borough](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-neighborhoods-in-nyc)or interest, to make the most of your time here.\n\n2. Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina and Virginia\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Best for Appalachian scenery**\n\nWhile the Rockies tend to get a lot of press \u2013 for good reason \u2013 the USA\u2019s oldest mountain range is also a must-see. Making up the southern third of the Appalachian Mountains (which stretch from [Newfoundland](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-to-newfoundland) to [Georgia](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/the-south/georgia)), the Blue Ridge Mountains are wrapped in lush forests that seem to shimmer in incredible blue-green vistas when seen from the region\u2019s many ridges and so-called \u201cbalds.\u201d Get into the woods on day hikes and mountain-biking excursions; cruise the [Blue Ridge Parkway](https://shop.lonelyplanet.com/products/blue-ridge-parkway-road-trips); or tackle a section of the storied [Appalachian Trail](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-to-the-appalachian-trail).\n\nA scenic stop along the parkway,[Asheville](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/the-south/asheville) is a charming [North Carolina](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/the-south/north-carolina) mountain town known for its thriving culinary and music scenes. Its historic downtown is filled with extensive art deco architecture, open-air bars, restaurants serving regional cuisine and galleries filled with the work of both local and regional artists.Asheville also has an extensive list of breweries, wineries and distilleries that offer tours.\n\nJust a few miles away, the renowned[Biltmore Estate](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/the-south/asheville/attractions/biltmore-estate/a/poi-sig/1128949/362216), built for the Vanderbilts and perhaps America\u2019s largest house, is an opulent fantasy inspired by the ch\u00e2teaux of Europe. A memorable if pricey tour of the 175,000-sq-ft home is a step into the Gilded Age, and one of the[top things to do in Asheville](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/top-things-to-do-in-asheville).\n\n![Image 26: A natural rock formation in the shape of an arch.

TRphotos/Shutterstock\n\n3. Southern Utah\n----------------\n\n**Best for geology**\n\nPerhaps no place reveals the scope of the USA\u2019s natural history like southern[Utah](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/southwest/utah). Home to [five of the country\u2019s most spectacular national parks](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/utah-national-parks-road-trip), Red Rock Country puts the region\u2019s geological past on display through jagged forms and almost neon colors. Hike the peaks and valleys of [Zion](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/utah/zion-bryce-canyon-national-parks)and [Bryce Canyon](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/southwest/bryce-canyon-national-park),or marvel at the crimson, ochre and amber palette in the cliffs and canyons of [Capitol Reef](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/southwest/south-central-and-southwestern-utah/attractions/capitol-reef-national-park/a/poi-sig/1253948/362162) and [Canyonlands](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/southwest/southeastern-utah/attractions/canyonlands-national-park/a/poi-sig/1111413/362166). If you want a truly memorable vista, watch the sun rise over the sandstone masterpieces at [Arches](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/southwest/southeastern-utah/attractions/arches-national-park/a/poi-sig/1111582/362166).\n\n**Planning tip:**Large swaths of this region are extremely remote and sometimes lack cell service, both on the road and on the trail. Always share your plans with others and bring plenty of water in case of emergencies.\n\n![Image 27: Boats are moored in a harbor of a city.

New England\n--------------\n\n**Best for forest drives and exploring charming centuries-old towns**\n\nWant to meander on mountain roads beneath brilliant forest canopies and savor tasty lobster and coastal views all in the same trip?[New England](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-england), the cluster of six states at the USA\u2019s northeast corner,is the place for you. Explore the quaint villages, cranberry bogs and golden beaches of [Cape Cod](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/cape-cod);snuggle into a cabin in[Vermont](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-england/vermont); tackle the mountains of [New Hampshire](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-to-new-hampshire); or dive into all the seafood you can eat in [Portland](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-to-portland-maine), [Maine](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-england/maine). And if you visit in autumn, prepare yourself for some of [the most spectacular fall foliage in the country](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-fall-colors-us).\n\n5. New Orleans, Louisiana\n-------------------------\n\n**Best for foodies and art lovers**\n\nThere\u2019s no place in the world like [New Orleans](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-orleans) \u2013 we promise. A vibrant cocktail of Indigenous, Caribbean, African, French and Spanish influences, [this city possesses a unique magic](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/top-things-to-do-in-new-orleans) that keeps people returning again and again. Dive into its legendary Creole cuisine, revel in its lively festivals and immerse yourself in a world-class music scene \u2013 this is the birthplace of jazz, after all.\n\nEat a beignet heaped with powdered sugar and drink a cup of chicory coffee at [Cafe du Monde](https://shop.cafedumonde.com/), which overlooks [Jackson Square](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-orleans/french-quarter/attractions/jackson-square/a/poi-sig/381165/1329657) and [St Louis Cathedral](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-orleans/french-quarter/attractions/st-louis-cathedral/a/poi-sig/381293/1329657). Then take a tour of the famously atmospheric streets of the French Quarter.\n\nBe sure to get beyond the Quarter, too. Explore the antique stores of Magazine St, take in the mansions and cemeteries of the [Garden District](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/garden-district-new-orleans-guide), play a round of golf in[Audubon Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-orleans/uptown-and-riverbend/attractions/audubon-park/a/poi-sig/1512150/1329661), or even [get out into nearby bayous](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-day-trips-new-orleans) on an airboat tour.\n\n Advertisement \n\n**Planning tip:**New Orleans\u2019 coastal location makes it susceptible to hurricanes from June through October, with the most active months being August and September.\n\n![Image 28: Man kayaking at a mangrove forest in the Everglades](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2023-08/GettyRF1049429486.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nSee the wonders of the Everglades up close on a kayaking tour \u00a9 Mariakray / Getty Images\n\n6. The Everglades, Florida\n--------------------------\n\n**Best for wildlife watchers**\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of [the Everglades](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/florida/the-everglades).This sprawling wetland ecosystem is home to a diverse profusion of flora and fauna, which has earned it a designation as an International Biosphere Reserve, a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/76/)and a [US national park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/florida/the-everglades/attractions/everglades-national-park/a/poi-sig/1366106/361921). You can take in the endless stretches of grass and bayous by slowly paddling through coastal estuaries in a kayak or whizzing through the numerous waterways via airboat. Camping overnight among the mangroves offers an even deeper connection to the place. All the while, keep your eyes peeled for wading birds, manatees, and (of course) alligators and crocodiles.\n\n**Planning tip:** For the best experience, come prepared for the elements. Sunscreen and bug spray are essentials.\n\n![Image 29: A car drives across an arched bridge crossing cliffs on the coast of an ocean.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-04/shutterstock2022974900.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nBixby Bridge in Big Sur, California. oliverdelahaye/Shutterstock\n\n7. Pacific Coast Highway\n------------------------\n\n**Best for West Coast exploration**\n\nThe Pacific Coast Highway connects sunny [San Diego](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-diego) with moody [Seattle](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/seattle), delivering epic West Coast experiences along its 1600-mile length. (Technically, it\u2019s three separate but continuous highways.) Along the way, you can stay at kitschy motels in coastal towns, admire the cliffs of [Big Sur](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/california/big-sur), marvel at the tide pools in [Oregon](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/pacific-northwest/oregon)and explore [Washington](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/pacific-northwest/washington)\u2019s[Olympic National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/pacific-northwest/olympic-national-park).\n\nOne small California town, San Simeon, is especially worth a stop.The oceanfront[Piedras Blancas Rookery](https://visitsansimeonca.com/what-to-do/elephant-seals-san-simeon/)is the only elephant-seal rookery in the world that\u2019s only easily accessible and free. The dozens of seals lounging in the sun and barking along the beach and rocks make for quite a spectacle.\n\nJust up the road is the fabled[Hearst Castle,](https://hearstcastle.org/) the former home of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst \u2013 and a monument to one man\u2019s over-the-top vision. It features a wild blend of architectural styles and details that take inspiration from everything from ancient Rome to the Renaissance, with orange groves and palms imported from the Canary Islands flanking the cathedral-like home.\n\n**Planning tip:**Sections of the PCH follow sea cliffs prone to rockslides. Always check road conditions before setting off in case of any unexpected closures.\n\n8. Washington, DC\n-----------------\n\n**Best for national history**\n\n[Washington, DC](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/washington-dc)\u2019s [National Mall](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-to-national-mall-washington-dc)embodies the ideals of American political life. Along this 2-mile strip \u2013 with the [US Capitol](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/washington-dc/capitol-hill-south-dc/attractions/us-capitol/a/poi-sig/385385/1329650)at one end and the[Lincoln Memorial](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/washington-dc/national-mall/attractions/lincoln-memorial/a/poi-sig/385369/1329647)at the other \u2013 the USA\u2019s cultural history is captured through iconic monuments and some the country\u2019s most famous museums. The mall contains 10 Smithsonian institutions \u2013 the [National Museum of Natural History](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/washington-dc/national-mall/attractions/national-museum-of-natural-history/a/poi-sig/1097056/1329647), the [National Museum of African American History and Culture](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/washington-dc/national-mall/attractions/national-museum-of-african-american-history-culture/a/poi-sig/1246939/1329647) and the [National Museum of American History,](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/washington-dc/national-mall/attractions/national-museum-of-american-history/a/poi-sig/1097060/1329647) among others \u2013 plus others including the [National Gallery of Art](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/washington-dc/national-mall/attractions/national-gallery-of-art/a/poi-sig/385373/1329647). The [Washington Monument](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/washington-dc/national-mall/attractions/washington-monument/a/poi-sig/385389/1329647) rises at the center of the Mall \u2013 reaching as high as the country\u2019s ideals.\n\n9. Santa Fe, New Mexico\n-----------------------\n\n**Best for Indigenous history and culture**\n\nYou can\u2019t escape the centuries of history in[Santa Fe](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/santa-fe) \u2013 yet this one-of-a-kind city always manages to keep up with the times. A cultural melange of Indigenous, Spanish and Mexican influences, this [New Mexican](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/southwest/new-mexico) capital is home to numerous historical sites, including its 400-year-old [Plaza](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/santa-fe/attractions/the-plaza/a/poi-sig/1347720/362156)and the [Loretto Chapel](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/santa-fe/attractions/loretto-chapel/a/poi-sig/414044/362156)(with its famous staircase).\n\nThe city is also famously creative: the surrounding desert landscapes provided endless inspiration to [Georgia O\u2019Keeffe](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/santa-fe/attractions/georgia-o-keeffe-museum/a/poi-sig/414032/362156), while upscale galleries along Canyon Rd are filled with works from contemporary artists. And then there\u2019s[Meow Wolf](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/santa-fe/attractions/meow-wolf/a/poi-sig/1558571/362156), the game-changing, genre-defying immersive art installation that has to be visited to be believed.\n\n**Detour:**Less than an hour's drive from Santa Fe, the [Puy\u00e9 Cliff Dwellings](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-mexico/northern-pueblos/attractions/puye-cliff-dwellings/a/poi-sig/1254453/1341886), carved into the rock face and atop the Santa Clara Canyon on Santa Clara Pueblo Reservation, were once home to 1500 Pueblo Indians. The site was abandoned in 1580; today, one-hour tours are conducted by the descendants of the original dwellers.\n\n10. San Francisco, California\n-----------------------------\n\n**Best for counterculture**\n\n[San Francisco](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco) combines the energy of a major city with a distinctly laid-back and gracious West Coast energy. Take in breathtaking bay views at [Golden Gate Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco/golden-gate-park-and-the-avenues/attractions/golden-gate-park/a/poi-sig/383395/1329646), wander the alleyways of the country\u2019s largest and oldest [Chinese neighborhood](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco/north-beach-and-chinatown), pay homage to LGBTIQ+ heroes in the Castro, or dive into cutting-edge art at [SFMOMA](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/san-francisco/downtown-and-civic-center/attractions/san-francisco-museum-of-modern-art/a/poi-sig/383419/1329640) and a plethora of local galleries.

Rocky Mountains, Colorado\n-----------------------------\n\n**Best for big peaks and winter sports**\n\nThe the Rockies in [Colorado](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/rocky-mountains/colorado) are simply astonishing \u2013 and even more beautiful than you\u2019ve heard. There are many ways to take them: with a hike in[Rocky Mountains National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/colorado/northern-colorado/attractions/rocky-mountain-national-park/a/poi-sig/1578014/1326457); by hitting the slopes in ski hubs like [Vail](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/rocky-mountains/vail), [Aspen](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/rocky-mountains/aspen) and Telluride; on a drive along the scenic byways of the San Juan range; or by camping in one of the state\u2019s numerous national forests. Nature\u2019s grandeur awaits.\n\n**Planning tip:** Unless you\u2019re from somewhere with similar elevation, you might feel the effects of altitude throughout the Rockies; stay extremely hydrated, take your time on hikes and skip the alcohol.\n\n![Image 32: Tourists admire iconic Cloud Gate at Millenium Park during early spring Rolf_52_Shutterstock.jpg](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2023-04/Tourists%20admire%20iconic%20Cloud%20Gate%20at%20Millenium%20Park%20during%20early%20spring%20Rolf_52_Shutterstock.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nChicago's streets are full of culture, fine dining and live music \u00a9 Rolf 52 / Shutterstock\n\n13.

Board a[boat](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/chicago-3-day-itinerary)for a narrated tour of the architectural wonders lining the Chicago River (the skyscraper was invented here, after all).

It is paradise. No hurries, no worries, just relax \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder around 30 million people a year head to the Caribbean for a respite.\n\nWhile the [Dominican Republic](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/dominican-republic), [Jamaica](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica), [Puerto Rico](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/puerto-rico), and [the Bahamas](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas) are hot spots, the Caribbean is also home to locales without hordes of tourists and some where there is more wildlife than people. So, if you\u2019re in the mood for the beauty without the bustle, here\u2019s where to go.\n\n1. Kamalame Cay, the Bahamas\n----------------------------\n\n**Best for a luxurious private island getaway**\n\n Advertisement \n\nSome things are worth waiting for. Get to [Nassau](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas/new-providence/nassau), hop on a commuter flight, take a cab to the dock and board a water taxi that takes you to[Kamalame Cay,](https://www.kamalame.com/) a private island in Andros in [the Bahamas](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas/). The resort is near the world\u2019s third-largest barrier reef with acres of coconut palm groves and vegetation that competes with the bluest sea for what is most awesome.\n\nIf you want an island escape, this might just be it. The bungalows, villas, cottages, and beach houses are spread out for miles. Wheel around in your golf cart on white sand roads and it\u2019s mostly you and Mother Nature with just enough people to have a little atmosphere. Activities include everything from deep-sea fishing and kayaking to playing tennis and cycling. If you\u2019re in chill mode, watch a movie at the alfresco cinema, climb in a hammock along the beach or head to the Bahamas\u2019 only overwater spa. You\u2019re also in good hands at the Great House restaurant, where the conch fritters, Asian barbecue spareribs, and the coconut green vegetable curry are crowd-pleasers.\n\nMake sure you venture back to Andros, with its underwater cave systems and the highest concentration of blue holes in the world. One of the most popular is Captain Bill\u2019s Blue Hole in [Blue Holes National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas/north-central-andros/attractions/blue-holes-national-park/a/poi-sig/1555378/1332437). After a short drive, make your way through the pine forest, get up your nerve and jump from the platform into the fresh water. For a quieter experience, head to the [Androsia Batik Factory](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas/north-central-andros/attractions/androsia-ltd/a/poi-sig/1393989/1332437) where you can learn about the art of batik-making and try your hand at it.\n\n![Image 25: A lush green coastline with a small village of houses](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2022-12/Jamaica-iStock-1000710180-RFC.jpeg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nBluefields is a chilled out spot on Jamaica's south coast \u00a9 dimarik / Getty Images\n\n2. Bluefields, Jamaica\n----------------------\n\n**Best for solitude**\n\nWhen you think Jamaica, [Montego Bay](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica/montego-bay) and [Negril](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica/negril-and-the-west/negril) probably come to mind. Skip the masses and head to Bluefields on the south coast instead. You can still arrange dive tours, deep-sea fishing, glass-bottom boat cruises but along this hilly stretch of coast, you\u2019re more likely to hear the cicadas\u2019 concert than anything loud and late.\n\nWhile you\u2019re in the area, take a tour of the [Bluefields Organic Fruit Farm](https://www.facebook.com/bluefieldsorganicfruitfarmtours/?ref=br_rs) where you'll learn a bit about organic farming and Jamaican agricultural history. Decide which island treats \u2013 perhaps coconuts, pineapples, naseberries, avocados, gineps, star apples or garden cherries \u2013 you want to take back to your hotel or the beach to enjoy.\n\nAlso nearby in Belmont Falls in a small yard off the main road is the monument that pays tribute to reggae legend Peter Tosh who spent his early years there. Tosh, one of the original Wailers, in reggae music history is not far behind icon Bob Marley. For an authentic Jamaican experience, mix it up with locals at [Bluefields Beach Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica/bluefields-belmont/attractions/bluefields-beach-park/a/poi-sig/1424487/1332805) where, at the weekends, families will be picnicking and the reggae music will be blasting.\n\n**Planning tip:** If after all that peace and solitude you want to liven things up a little, Negril is an hour away. Here you'll find hipster haunts like Rick\u2019s Caf\u00e9 where you can dance and watch folks jump from cliffs into the sea.\n\n3. South Caicos, Turks and Caicos\n---------------------------------\n\n**Best for finding your zen**\n\n Advertisement \n\n[Providenciales](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turks-and-caicos/caicos-islands/providenciales) gets all the glory, but [South Caicos](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turks-and-caicos) is a Caribbean gem worth your time. Fly into Providenciales and take a 30-minute flight to South Caicos. Location is everything. Don\u2019t look for bars and mega resorts, but wild donkeys and salt flats with pink flamingos.\n\nLet nature soothe your soul. There are two beaches here with possible dolphin- and humpback whale-sightings. Visit Iguana Island and the aquarium, a protected reef ideal for snorkeling, and get a glimpse of local life in old town Cockburn. For fun and fantastic food, make your way to Triple J\u2019s, a backyard barbecue restaurant only open on the weekends. It's a friendly spot where the music is pumping. Fill up on jerk pork, chicken, ribs, grilled lobster, fish and conch, and of course peas and rice.\n\nTake an excursion to Long Cay, part of the Admiral Cockburn Land and Sea National Park, a protected area full of ospreys, egrets, herons and more. Long Cay is also where you\u2019ll find tons of Rock Iguanas. South Caicos is typically pretty windy and there are many flat water and bay kiting locations, so kiteboarders will have plenty of reasons to be psyched.\n\n**Planning tip:** Consider spending a day in Providenciales. There are new hot spots like the [BLT Steakhouse](https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/caribbean/turks-and-caicos/dining) at the Ritz-Carlton and the uber-luxe [MRVL Spa](https://www.mrvlspa.com/) for next-level pampering.\n\n![Image 26: Scuba divers in full gear head down stairs towards a beach for a shore dive](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2022-12/Bonaire-iStock-1170310192-RFE.jpeg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nBonaire has nearly 90 dive sites to experience \u00a9 Orietta Gaspari / Getty Images\n\n4. Bonaire\n----------\n\n**Best for diving**\n\n[Bonaire](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/bonaire), one of the ABC islands ([Aruba](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/aruba), Bonaire and [Cura\u00e7ao](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/curacao)), doesn\u2019t get the buzz of the other two. But divers know this part of the Dutch Caribbean is where the action is, with nearly 90 dive sites, coral reefs, and sea caves. Iguanas, parrots, and other critters call Bonaire home, and [Gotomeer](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/bonaire/north-of-kralendijk/attractions/gotomeer/a/poi-sig/1549190/1330986) is a saltwater lagoon on the island\u2019s northern end where you\u2019ll see flamingos.\n\nThere\u2019s fun to be had at [Washington-Slagbaai National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/bonaire/north-of-kralendijk/attractions/washington-slagbaai-national-park/a/poi-sig/365861/1330986), be it hiking to the tallest peak at Mt Brandaris, cliff-jumping into turquoise waters at Boka Slagbaii or chilling in the tide pool at Boka Kokolishi. Windsurf and kayak through mangroves. For a unique golfing experience, play on Bonaire\u2019s natural golf desert course (where wild goats and donkeys roam). When hunger calls, you can find everything from a food truck on the beach to fine dining in Sebastian\u2019s.\n\n5. Nevis, St Kitts and Nevis\n----------------------------\n\n**Best for hikers**\n\n[Nevis](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-and-nevis/nevis), in the Leeward Islands, is one of the Caribbean\u2019s best kept secrets. The smaller of the dual-island nation of [St Kitts and Nevis](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-and-nevis), its mystique is the inactive volcano, mountains, often shrouded in mist, and the Nevis Peak at more than 975m (3200ft). The beaches are beautiful and uncrowded where wild donkeys, goats, and green vervet monkeys roam. Take an adventurous climb up Mt Nevis or a less intense hike to rainforest waterfalls.\n\nDon\u2019t miss [the Botanical Gardens of Nevis](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-nevis/south-nevis/attractions/botanical-gardens-of-nevis/a/poi-sig/1055861/1005470), home to tropical plants from around the world and stunning artwork. The [Nevis Equestrian Centre](https://www.nevishorseback.com/) offers rides that include beaches, trails, and villages. The fishing is good in these parts too, where barracuda, sailfish, and blue marlin are plentiful.\n\nDine at The Rocks that sits 300m (1000ft) above sea level on the grounds of the [Golden Rock Inn](https://www.goldenrocknevis.com/), where you can enjoy magnificent sea views, cascading ponds, and lush gardens. For a history lesson, there\u2019s Hamilton House, the Georgian style building in Charlestown where Alexander Hamilton was born and raised, now the [Museum of Nevis History](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-and-nevis/nevis/charlestown/attractions/museum-of-nevis-history/a/poi-sig/1396674/358150).\n\nConsider staying at the [Four Seasons Resort](https://www.fourseasons.com/nevis/) on Pinney\u2019s Beach. Sit seaside, nestled by rocks watching the sunset at the resort\u2019s Mango restaurant. Another good choice is [The Hermitage](https://hermitagenevis.com/) at the foot of a rainforest covered mountain.\n\n**Planning tip:**Spend a day on the sister island of St Kitts where you can hike Mt Liamuiga Volcano and check out [Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-nevis/northern-st-kitts/attractions/brimstone-hill-fortress-national-park/a/poi-sig/1396637/1331211).\n\n![Image 27: A woman stands on a board walk that cuts through a dense rainforest landscape](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2022-12/Dominica-iStock-82068128-RFC.jpeg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nHire a guide to get the best out of your time in Dominica \u00a9 David Madison / Getty Images\n\n6. Dominica\n-----------\n\n**Best for nature lovers**\n\nNot to be confused with the Dominican Republic, [Dominica](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/dominica) is one of the most unique Caribbean islands. Nicknamed \u201cThe nature island of the Caribbean\u201d, the thrills are loggerhead turtles, whales, hot springs, boiling lakes, mountains, waterfalls, and black sand beaches.\n\n[Morne Trois Pitons National Park](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/814/) is a national treasure with spots like [Trafalgar Falls](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/dominica/trafalgar-falls/attractions/trafalgar-falls/a/poi-sig/1020530/358046). Morne Trois Pitons is an active volcano, one of nine in Dominica. Trek the park\u2019s trails with views of mountains and the rainforest. Kayak and snorkel in [Soufriere-Scott\u2019s Head Marine Reserve](https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6022/). For a wellness themed retreat there\u2019s [Jungle Bay](https://www.junglebaydominica.com/caribbean-islands-packages?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyracBhDoARIsACGFcS63KJ_Yna0bdZYytZ9EtH2nBJCEU4ycyY5c1Q4l0_BsxaH9YJ2rqfcaArRREALw_wcB) on nearly 20 acres of lush landscape. Revitalize yourself at the Bamboo Spa with the signature Jungle Bay Massage with coconut, castor and bay essential oils.\n\n**Planning tip:** Have the concierge hook you up with a local guide. Dominica has many nooks and crannies you might not discover on your own.\n\n7. Tobago\n---------\n\n**Best for bird-watchers**\n\n[Trinidad](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/trinidad-and-tobago/trinidad) is beloved for its iconic carnival, but sister island [Tobago](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/trinidad-and-tobago/tobago) is often overlooked. This less-traveled paradise is a must for bird-watchers. Tobago has one of the highest densities of bird species in the world, with more than 200 varieties. Tobago\u2019s Unesco World Heritage Site, [Main Ridge Forest Reserve](https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5646/) is the oldest protected forest in the western hemisphere, with nine trails to keep hikers happy.\n\nYou'll hear great music in the birthplace of the steel pan drum. Soak up the sounds on a Sunday night at the legendary street party, [Buccoo Sunday School](http://www.buccoo.net/treasures/buccoo-sunday-school) in Buccoo. Those with a sweet tooth might want to book a tour of the [Tobago Cocoa Estate](https://www.tobagococoa.com/). The island's best beaches include Buccoo Bay and Englishman\u2019s Bay, or cool off with a bold jump into Argyle Falls, Tobago\u2019s highest waterfall.\n\n8. Canouan, St Vincent and the Grenadines\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Best for turtle lovers**\n\nHere, tortoises outnumber people. What you will find plenty of on this 3.5-mile island in [St Vincent and the Grenadines](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-vincent-and-the-grenadines), is boats, incredible ones at the [Sandy Lane Yacht Club](https://slycr.com/berthing/). Canouan has bragging rights for being surrounded by the Caribbean\u2019s largest living coral reef and there\u2019s good fly-fishing and kitesurfing here too. Check into the [Mandarin Oriental, Canouan](https://www.mandarinoriental.com/en/canouan/caribbean) and you may feel like you\u2019re in a private-island sanctuary, a secret escape, with just 26 suites and 13 villas on the 1200-acre estate that\u2019s on Godahl Beach. Spend time on the 18-hole golf course or relaxing in the spa. Snorkeling in lagoons and hiking up Mt.
