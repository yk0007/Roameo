Saw leopard, Bengal tiger, lion etc. But overall impression was that the zoo could do better on upkeep, place has a run down feel about it. Ticketing counter is a nightmare, wonder what it will take for the tickets to be made available online! We took a battery operated car which has 30 min waiting for a 1 hour journey. Worthwhile as the park is huge and with small kids it\u2019s difficult to walk. But you can also pay to take your own vehicle inside which may not be a bad option also.

Only jeeps take you to the Katika falls - jeep drivers drive very rashly ... Tourists have to be more responsible in keeping the place clean.

Though my wife recently underwent total.knee replacement , still we set out for Araku and as part of it, this place. Lovely , gushing water from the rocks, nice cascading effect. The steps are not very steep. However, senior citizens( we too are) have to go slow. I climbed down all the steps ( about 100) and reached a bridge.
