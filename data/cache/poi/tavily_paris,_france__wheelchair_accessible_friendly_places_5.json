In the reviews, some are described as the seating being \"close\". Will this be a problem for me, since i am in a wheelchair?\n\nSome of the restaurants on my list are: 7eme Vin, [Le Florimond](/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d719117-Reviews-Le_Florimond-Paris_Ile_de_France.html), Restaurant de la Tour, La Mariette, Cafe Constant, Le Petite Bordelais, Pasco.

However, it is important to know that restrooms are often not accessible for wheelchairs (or even on the main dining floor).\n\n![](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/61/39/da/pjk.jpg)\n\nI am visualizing 7eme vin in my mind and I see tables set close together with only a small amount of space between them. I think it wouold be difficult. But in June would a few restaurants like this be easier for you...\n\n[http://im1.shutterfly.com/media/47a0ce10b3127ccefb2b9af3daa300000030O00AbtHLVw2as2YPbz4E/cC/f%3D0/ls%3D00303568594720101031073123798.JPG/ps%3D50/r%3D0/rx%3D550/ry%3D400/](/ExternalLinkInterstitial?redirectTo=http%3A%2F%2Fim1.shutterfly.com%2Fmedia%2F47a0ce10b3127ccefb2b9af3daa300000030O00AbtHLVw2as2YPbz4E%2FcC%2Ff%253D0%2Fls%253D00303568594720101031073123798.JPG%2Fps%253D50%2Fr%253D0%2Frx%253D550%2Fry%253D400%2F)\n\nPjk\n\n![](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/6f/1f/d7/parisix.jpg)\n\nAmong your selection, Cafe Constant would also be a bit tricky IMO.

That will make a difference. My father went to [Paris](/Tourism-g187147-Paris_Ile_de_France-Vacations.html) a few years ago while in a wheelchair; he sometimes had to wait outside the restaurant while my mother went in to ask about the access (although they'd inquired in advance). On one occasion he was carried inside in his chair. And forget about the restroom. I'd advise sending an email to the restaurant asking specific questions about access, including steps to go inside, steps inside (if you can handle any walking), toilettes, etc.\n\nTry using google maps to see the outside access. Also, review-type sites like tripadvisor and John Talbott 's Paris have more photos of interiors. (also check TheFork.com.)\n\nI loved Restaurant Mariette, and I think it is roomy enough inside. (for a tiny restaurant), but it appears that there is a step up to get in.\n\nI think 7eme vin is too tight (and not my favorite anyway). Le Violon d'Ingres is expensive, but my memory is that it is roomier than many other places.\n\nI enjoy staying in that neighborhood and hope you do too.\n\nAccess on the buses is quite good. The sidewalks on some of the narrow streets might be a challenge.\n\nGood luck!\n\n![](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/2e/70/8d/avatar014.jpg)\n\nThis is a few years old, but might be helpful: [http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2008/02/accessible-trav/](/ExternalLinkInterstitial?redirectTo=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.davidlebovitz.com%2F2008%2F02%2Faccessible-trav%2F)\n\n![SO/ Paris](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/30/80/91/8c/exterior.jpg)\n![Novotel Paris Centre Gare Montparnasse](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/30/96/77/de/exterior.jpg)\n![Hotel Signature Saint Germain des Pres](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/28/d6/91/19/the-team.jpg)\n![Pullman Paris Eiffel Tower](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/30/80/37/fe/exterior.jpg)\n![Novotel Paris Les Halles](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/30/b5/82/c7/exterior.jpg)\n![Hotel Mercure Paris Centre Tour Eiffel](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/30/53/79/22/exterior.jpg)\n![Hotel Malte - Astotel](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0f/6d/c9/1a/superior-twin-room.jpg)\n![B Montmartre Hotel](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2c/28/02/08/exterior.jpg)\n![Hotel La Manufacture](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/2c/21/4f/68/room.jpg)\n\n# Restaurants in a wheelchair - Paris Forum\n\n![Tripadvisor](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/brand_refresh_2025/logos/logo.svg)\n\nTripadvisor LLC makes no guarantees for availability of prices advertised on our sites and applications.

We received the VIP treatment at all the museums we visited. Orsay, Rodin, Picasso and Petit Palais. Being in a wheelchair, we were not asked for proof of disability. The buses were excellent but mostly we walked/rolled. Restaurants frequently had 1 step which I could navigate. People were extremely helpful.\n\nReply [...] Orsay Museum: No reservations or payment needed, no proof of disability asked for, and wheelchair provided and used. The location of the sole lift was a little inconvenient though. Don't miss the mezzanine with the art nouveau rooms, btw. They let us in through a secret door!\n\nPantheon: Free entry once again, although I may have had to whip out the US disabled placard for proof. [...] The Louvre: Again, we had made reservations, but no one even asked to see them, or any proof of disability. They saw my partner with her poles, and told us to go straight to the Pyramid entrance, where staff ushered us inside right away, past the long snaking line. Completely free of charge too! They also have wheelchairs that you can take out for free, which is very useful, because even though my partner can walk, it saved us enormous time at the pace she would be walking at. Locations of",

Before going, I did extensive research on what we could really expect in terms of being able to skip those epic lines. The cost issue was not important; mainly we wanted to know what proof of disability was really required in order to take advantage of skipping lines for Paris attractions. We read the official websites, but as tourists (and not French-speaking ones), we really couldn't provide the kind of official \"proof\" that was usually called for, since we have no French or European disability card. And finding information on the internet on what it was like in reality, was very difficult.\n\nSo now, having gone, I was inspired to write this post, because maybe it will help others. It's not intended to be a comprehensive guideline, and as always, YMMV. But still, it might give you an idea of what to expect.\n\nI guess I should start with CDG. It's a legendary nightmare to navigate, and being disabled doesn't make it any better. We were informed that the promised wheelchair to swiftly take us through customs and immigration, would not materialize until everyone else deplaned. At that point we made a decision to just walk out (best as my partner could). It would be slow, but maybe faster than waiting. On the way out, I didn't see anyone even approaching the [plane](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g187147-Paris_Ile_de_France-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) with a wheelchair, so probably a good move. Lucky for us, we simply found one. And from that point, we were ushered into the fast lanes for everything that had a wait.\n\n[Paris Metro](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d2323543-Reviews-Paris_Metro-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) is definitely a difficult situation, because lifts are few and far between, interchanges are long, and stairs are many. Even though the metro zips you around the fastest way for an able bodied person, for us, it was avoided in favor of the bus whenever possible. Once on the Metro, however, my partner was never without a seat. No matter how crowded, someone would always give up their seat, which is a plus. Same goes for the bus.\n\nNow... once you're visiting museums and attractions, however, being disabled becomes almost a Super Power! Lines are legendary for Paris attractions, even in the \"shoulder\" season. And some are now requiring timed reservations, even if you have a Pass. TLDR: if you have a disability, forget the lines and reservations with the hoi polloi (*for the most part), and most things will be free to boot -for the disabled person, PLUS one companion. In most cases, we were not required to present any proof (the prima facie evidence of my partner's disability was proof enough... with a few notable exceptions below). Here is what we encountered at different locations:\n\nOrangerie: We made reservations in advance just in case (but did not pay for tickets). In any case, none were needed. Staff took one look at us, and didn't even ask for anything. They just ushered us past the lines (including the passholder line), opened a side door, waved us past the ticket counters, and we were in right away!\n\nThe Louvre: Again, we had made reservations, but no one even asked to see them, or any proof of disability. They saw my partner with her poles, and told us to go straight to the Pyramid entrance, where staff ushered us inside right away, past the long snaking line. Completely free of charge too! They also have wheelchairs that you can take out for free, which is very useful, because even though my partner can walk, it saved us enormous time at the pace she would be walking at. Locations of lifts were pointed out, most of which were mainly for the use of disabled people. Furthermore, within the Louvre, there were places where the crowds were controlled, notably in front of the Mona Lisa. The crowd is held in place at some distance from the painting, and this is controlled by staff. For us, we just went straight to the front, and staff ushered us in, in front of everyone and right up to the railing in front of the painting. Pretty cool!\n\nDior Museum: So here I did buy tickets in advance. It's a private museum, not part of either the national or Paris Museum system. You need a timed reservation and I wasn't sure whether they would ask for proof. They did look at our reservation, but then ushered us straight in. Not sure if I really needed to pay for those tickets or not.\n\n[Conciergerie](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d190683-Reviews-Conciergerie-Paris_Ile_de_France.html): We did make a free reservation for the Conciergerie and Saint Chapelle. Conciergerie, a relatively minor attraction, was one place where they did ask us for some \"official\" documentation of disability. Since there is no equivalent of the French disability card, all we could produce was a US handicapped [car](https://www.tripadvisor.com/RentalCars.html?geo=187147) placard and accompanying letter. That was enough, but they did ask to see the letter. Even though it was in English, that was enough. No payment needed.\n\nNote: for most people, they are very strict on the time. One (able-bodied) person was told that their reservation was for the nearby Saint Chapelle, and they needed to run over there quick otherwise they would miss their time. For us, no such requirement was ever mentioned even though we were a little late.\n\nSaint-Chapelle: The gendarmes ushered us in through the nearby government building. No lines to contend with. The ticket counter did ask for proof of disability, then waved us in without charge. No one asked about our reservation, which is a must for everyone else. Lines are crazy long for able-bodied people.\n\nNapoleon's Tomb and Army Museum: \"Disability tickets\" were dispensed free of charge and without asking for proof, IIRC. Wheelchair was offered, but we chose not to take them up on it. But right now, it's a royal pain to get there. There's only one entrance right now due to construction, and if you're on the other side, it's a good kilometer to get to it!\n\nThe [Eiffel Tower](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188151-Reviews-Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html): Ah, this is a real tricky one! I think you're entitled to free entry without timed reservations, but this is the one place where you may not want to take advantage of it! So here's the deal: under ordinary (able-bodied) circumstances, if you don't reserve long in advance, you will wait in several lines, AND the tickets to the top will likely be sold out. So we reserved (and paid for) tickets to the top. *However*, it clearly states that you can NOT buy these tickets for a disabled person! Something about safety. Disabled people are only allowed to the second level. Well... my motto has always been that it's better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission, so that's what we did. It worked through the initial line to get in. The staffer ushered us to the front of the security line because of disability, not looking that we had those green to-the-top tickets that my partner was not supposed to have. However, the person manning the lines to the first of the entrance lifts caught the error, and insisted that we cannot have those tickets to the top (or at least not my partner. We tried to insist that she wasn't really that disabled. He had her try to walk without her poles, but upon seeing her gait, he was like, \"Nope.\" It was all very polite. He literally told us, \"I'm not a bad person,\" and proceeded to explain that if there was a bomb threat, she'd have to walk down a thousand stairs. But as a consolation prize, he told us we could skip the line to the lift, but instructed us to go to the second level and ask for a refund of our money instead of going to the top. Which we dutifully agreed to (no sense in arguing)... with every intention of still trying to do what we came to do anyway on the next level. I know, I know... bad. But look, she really wanted to go to the top, and no little disability was going to hold her back! So, as it turned out, crowds were very tight to cram into those elevators to the top. We hid my partner's poles, she held my hand instead, and with the tight crowds, the ticket taker couldn't see that she was walking funny. I mean, it's not like the guy below radioed up and said \"Be on the lookout for such and such a person.\" That's one reason I chose not to argue and give him every impression that we intended to follow his instructions on the second level. So, with champagne glasses in hand, we celebrated at the top of La Tour Eiffel!! fwiw, if all else fails, the second level is really not that bad. Some say it has better views than at the top, and in a sense they're kind of right. But we really did want to go to the top. Once in a lifetime and all that.\n\nOrsay Museum: No reservations or payment needed, no proof of disability asked for, and wheelchair provided and used. The location of the sole lift was a little inconvenient though. Don't miss the mezzanine with the art nouveau rooms, btw. They let us in through a secret door!\n\nPantheon: Free entry once again, although I may have had to whip out the US disabled placard for proof.\n\nCatacombs: Disabled people and one companion are entitled to free admission per the website, but I went ahead and paid for tickets and reservations, because I wasn't sure about the whole \"proof\" thing, and because I wasn't sure if they'd let us in in case they were sold out (they probably would). They do warn you that there are over 100 steps down and then similar number back up, and no wheelchair access. Hiking poles are allowed though.\n\nOpera Garnier: Again, I paid in advance for tickets and reservations, because I wasn't sure how they'd handle the proof of disability thing, and you needed reservations to be guaranteed entry. And it didn't look like there was a way to make reservations without paying for a ticket. As it turned out, it was the one place where we were *not* ushered to the front of the line.\n\n[Arc de Triomphe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188709-Reviews-Arc_de_Triomphe-Paris_Ile_de_France.html): Did not make any reservations or pay. Went to the front of the ticket line, and presented proof of partner's disability. They then gave us two no-charge tickets. But what's really special is that you get to skip BOTH sets of stairs and go up these funky elevators. A staffer comes to get you, they open up a special door, and you go into this oddly shaped elevator with a glass ceiling inside one of the legs of the Arch. On the museum level above, you ask for the other elevator to the very top. Apparently it's not always working, but this time they made it work after 15 minutes or so ... sort of. It's quite slow, and you hold the button continuously. The open air platform lift takes you to the top painfully slowly. Then the door opens up... or not... they may need to work on getting that upper level door to open, and Voila! (as the French say), you're at the top of the Arc de Triomphe without having to do the work!\n\nPalais Galeria: Again, no charge for us. I don't think they even asked for proof. They apologized for the lift being out of order.\n\nVersailles: We had (free) reservations, which can be made online for disabled people. The website says everyone needs a reservation. We flashed our proof as we entered, and they waved us right in at the entrance, past all the lines. Inside, we got a free wheelchair (only for use at the main palace), and I presented proof of disability (US handicapped placard), and they said I was actually entitled to a free audioguide. The reservation was only for the main chateau, but the Trianon palace was just free for us because of my partner (no proof asked for). But oddly enough, the Petit Train that would get you there to save on the walk, was not free! Disabled people get in free if they get there, but you're on your own for transport! Weird. And the wheelchairs can't be taken outside the chateau.\n\nSacre Coeur: it's free anyway, except for the dome climb. But that's not possible for many disabled people anyway.\n\nFinally, a note on Paris restaurants. Many are in old buildings, and the bathroom is very often down a [flight](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g187147-Paris_Ile_de_France-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) of stairs. Too bad Michelin Starred restaurants aren't free for disabled folks :)\n\n[Reply](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n Report inappropriate content \n\n##### 61 replies to this topic\n\n1-10 _of_ 61 replies \n\nSorted by\n\n\u00ab1[2](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-o10-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)[3](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-o20-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)[4](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-o30-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)[5](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-o40-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)[6](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-o50-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)[7](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-o60-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)[\u00bb](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-o10-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n[](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n[![Image 5](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif)](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RivieraBear?tab=forum)\n\n[RivieraBear](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RivieraBear?tab=forum)\n\nNice, France\n\n[](https://www.tripadvisor.com/help/who_are_the_destination_experts_on_the_forums#HEADING)\n\nDestination Expert\n\nfor Nice\n\n![Image 6](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/badge_forum_posts.png)27,727 posts\n\n![Image 7](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/Appreciated.png)143 helpful votes\n\n1.

Re: Paris With Disabilities -Our Experience \n\n1 year ago\n\nSave\n\nThank you so much for such a detailed post!! I\u2019m disabled and we\u2019re going to [Paris](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187147-Paris_Ile_de_France-Vacations.html) at Christmas and I\u2019ve been wondering what I\u2019ll need to show to confirm my disability. I do have the disabled placard, did you bring the original or a copy of it with you? What was included in the letter? Was it just a letter from the doctor stating she was disabled? I don\u2019t use a walking stick, but I do have issues with standing for long periods of time and walking long distances so I\u2019m hoping to use the disabled access lines and the wheelchair when I need it.\n\nI did notice the [Eiffel Tower](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188151-Reviews-Eiffel_Tower-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) limitation and we decided to buy regular tickets, also with the champagne since they were the only tickets left.\n\nThankfully we\u2019re arriving in [London](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g186338-London_England-Vacations.html) and leaving from Paris, so, hopefully, LHR is better with the wheelchairs meeting the [plane](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Flights-g187147-Paris_Ile_de_France-Cheap_Discount_Airfares.html) because I won\u2019t be able to do all that walking.\n\nAny other tips you can offer? I\u2019m definitely taking notes from your post to help plan our days in Paris.\n\n[Reply](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n Report inappropriate content \n\n[](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n[![Image 14](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif)](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregsf11?tab=forum)\n\n[gregsf11](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregsf11?tab=forum)\n\nSan Francisco...\n\n![Image 15](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/badge_forum_posts.png)194 posts\n\n![Image 16](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/Appreciated.png)697 helpful votes\n\n4. Re: Paris With Disabilities -Our Experience \n\n1 year ago\n\nSave\n\nOh... I forgot, one note on Versailles. As usual, once you're there, there's no problem. But getting there is another matter. The quickest way by transport is the RER C, but there's no way to avoid the approximately 1 KM walk from the station to the Chateau. There is a bus from the Western edge of [Paris](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187147-Paris_Ile_de_France-Vacations.html) that takes you much closer to the Chateau (171, I believe). You could get to the bus terminus in Paris by Metro, but overall this might take longer.\n\nSo the bottom line in Paris:\n\n-If you're disabled (plus one companion), there is no need to buy any tickets or museum passes for attractions that are part of the national museum system (basically anything covered by the Paris Museum Pass).\n\n-Free reservations may be helpful to have, though likely not necessary, even at the most impacted sites.\n\n-Bring proof, but they're not super strict on what *kind* of proof. They just need something official from your country.\n\n-For private museums and independent attractions, it is *usually* the same, because it turns out they really bend over backwards to accommodate the disabled. But if there's a popular and crowded attraction that is really on your \"must see\" list, it might be better to just reserve and pay just in case.\n\n[Reply](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n Report inappropriate content \n\n[](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n[![Image 17](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif)](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregsf11?tab=forum)\n\n[gregsf11](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gregsf11?tab=forum)\n\nSan Francisco...\n\n![Image 18](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/badge_forum_posts.png)194 posts\n\n![Image 19](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/Appreciated.png)697 helpful votes\n\n5. Re: Paris With Disabilities -Our Experience \n\n1 year ago\n\nSave\n\n@EllieandMilo:\n\nThe US disabled placard comes with a letter from the state. I haven't looked at it too closely, and I don't think they did either, on the one or two occasions where they even asked me to show it. But from what I understand, all it says is basically matches the person on the ID to the number of the placard. No one ever asked for a doctor's note.\n\nOther tips... not sure if you're staying in a hotel or renting an apartment. If it's the latter, make sure there is a lift. Much of [Paris](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187147-Paris_Ile_de_France-Vacations.html) is Housmann buildings from the 1800's with 7 floors and no lift, so always ask which floor your accommodation is at and whether there is a lift.\n\nAlso, download the BonjourRATP app on your phone. It is very easy to use and better than google in terms of giving you the very best way to get from point A to Point B at any time. And unlike google, it will have all the latest estimated arrival times for transport, takes into account delays, strikes, accidents, and breakdowns. For example, it might say that my trip would be a 15 minute walk... or there is a bus right there that will take 10 minutes and cut the walk down to 5 minutes. For an able bodied person, it doesn't matter at all. But for someone who can't walk long distances, it makes a huge difference.\n\n[Reply](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n Report inappropriate content \n\n[](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n[![Image 20](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif)](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieandMilo?tab=forum)\n\n[EllieandMilo](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EllieandMilo?tab=forum)\n\nMemphis, Tennessee\n\n![Image 21](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/badge_forum_posts.png)60 posts\n\n![Image 22](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/Appreciated.png)5 helpful votes\n\n6.

Re: Paris With Disabilities -Our Experience \n\n1 year ago\n\nSave\n\n@Euromanic:\n\nThanks for your perspective. Yes, behind every rule known to man, there is a reason. Obviously, *someone* in a position of authority decided it would be a good idea. Otherwise there would be no such rule! For example, someone in a position of authority made a rule that there be no selfie sticks allowed at the [Arc de Triomphe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d188709-Reviews-Arc_de_Triomphe-Paris_Ile_de_France.html). Yes, if you read the rules, such a rule exists. After all, someone can poke an eye out!! Or maybe you can hide a bomb inside it that looks like a selfie stick!!! Who knows? I'm sure anything is possible! That said, many people brought selfie sticks and used them. Unfortunately we did not, because like fools, we read the rules. Had we known no one would check, we would have brought our selfie stick too, just like every other tourist on the Arc.\n\nFew of us follow every rule in the world. If you're one of those who do, congratulations to you.\n\n[Reply](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n Report inappropriate content \n\n[](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n[![Image 32](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif)](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardo9876?tab=forum)\n\n[ed b](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/edwardo9876?tab=forum)\n\nGreen Valley...\n\n![Image 33](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/badge_forum_posts.png)1,408 posts\n\n![Image 34](https://static.tacdn.com/img2/badges/20px/Appreciated.png)18 helpful votes\n\n10. Re: Paris With Disabilities -Our Experience \n\n1 year ago\n\nSave\n\nWe visited [Paris](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g187147-Paris_Ile_de_France-Vacations.html) for week in August. We stayed in a ground floor apartment behind the Orsay. I use a small electric wheelchair but can walk short distances. We received the VIP treatment at all the museums we visited. Orsay, Rodin, Picasso and [Petit Palais](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g187147-d232167-Reviews-Petit_Palais-Paris_Ile_de_France.html). Being in a wheelchair, we were not asked for proof of disability. The buses were excellent but mostly we walked/rolled. Restaurants frequently had 1 step which I could navigate. People were extremely helpful.\n\n[Reply](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g187147-i14-k14576323-Paris_With_Disabilities_Our_Experience-Paris_Ile_de_France.html)\n\n Report inappropriate content

Andy Soloman/Shutterstock\n\n*Alexis is one of the authors of our [latest Paris guidebook](https://shop.lonelyplanet.com/products/paris). Here she shares her tips on navigating Paris' public transport, taxis and more.*\n\n[Paris](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/paris) is a gorgeous sprawl of beautiful monuments and interesting neighborhoods, and for many, walking is the way to go.\n\nTo cover the most ground, the convenient Paris metro blankets the city. Meanwhile, the comprehensive bus system allows you to [sightsee while traveling](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-things-to-do-in-paris), and cycling in the open air is as delightful as it looks. Here's what you need to know about Paris\u00e2\u0080\u0099 transport network, tickets and taxis.\n\n![Entrance of Porte Dauphine station](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-07/shutterstock2132894235.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## The quickest way to get around is on the metro and RER\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 train network consists of two separate but linked systems: the metro and the RER. The metro currently has 16 lines (numbered 1\u00e2\u0080\u009314, plus two secondary lines, 3bis and 7bis). The network is currently being expanded to add another four lines as part of the Grand Paris Express project. The RER has five main lines, A to E. The systems are fully integrated and you can easily transfer from one train to another. RER express trains save time crossing the city and serve the suburbs.\n\nEscalators and elevators ease long climbs within the stations, but are not available at every station. Service is very frequent, with wait times generally under five minutes. Some metro lines run above street level, offering scenic views. It's usually quicker to walk than to take the metro for only one or two stops.\n\n![Tramway bus on a street in Paris](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-07/shutterstock2481592757.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## For a better look at the city, hop on the bus\n\nWith no stairs, buses are widely accessible and are good for parents with prams/strollers and people with limited mobility. Bus lines complement the metro: for some journeys a bus is the more direct \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and scenic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 way to go. Stops show schedules, routes and often the wait time until the next bus.\n\n## A local\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tips for taking the metro, RER and bus\n\nUse the [RATP](https://www.ratp.fr/en), [IDF Mobilit\u00c3\u00a9s](https://www.iledefrance-mobilites.fr/en) and [SNCF](https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-en) apps for journey planning, route maps and wait times for the next train or bus, or to charge up your travel passes. Also, metro and bus maps of various sizes and degrees of detail are available for free at metro ticket windows.\n\nIn metro stations and on board, keep an eye out for pickpockets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re top zones of action.\n\n![A Batobus shuttle riverboat full of tourists passes under the Pont Alexandre III.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-07/Shutterstock1461123989.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## Sail in style on the Batobus\n\nCombining scenery and convenience, the [Batobus](https://www.batobus.com/en) is a handy hop-on, hop-off service stopping at nine key destinations along the Seine. In warmer months the service runs regularly through the day and offers a chance for a river cruise at a fraction of the price of a tour boat.\n\n## Cycle the streets with V\u00c3\u00a9lib\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bike-share\n\nThe [V\u00c3\u00a9lib\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bike-share scheme](https://www.velib-metropole.fr/) has over 20,000 bikes, both classic (green) and electric (blue) at 1400 stations citywide. Buy a subscription online using your RATP Navigo transit pass or credit card, or at docking stations (it only accepts European-compatible chip-and-pin credit cards). There are single-trip, day and multiday pass options. App-based electric *trottinettes* (scooters), wildly popular with tourists, were discontinued in September 2023 by popular vote.\n\n## Consider getting a Navigo transport pass\n\nThe cheapest and easiest way to use public transport in Paris is via the Navigo Easy card. Sold for \u00e2\u0082\u00ac2 (US$2) at all metro and RER ticket windows as well as RATP-affiliated outlets (e.g., tobacconists and markets), this credit-card-sized fare card is used for all your ticketing needs. You can also charge one up virtually on the RATP app for free.\n\nNavigo, like London\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Oyster card or Hong Kong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Octopus card, is a system that provides a full range of fare options. You load the card with value, which is then deducted for each ride. To save money, buy carnets, which are credits for 10 rides sold at a discount (this is the cheapest way to ride the metro and buses). You can also buy various passes that are good for unlimited rides across a range of fare zones and durations (such as Mobilis, with one day of unlimited travel). However, one disadvantage of passes is that they are tied to the calendar. For example, a one-day pass starts at 12:01am, a seven-day pass always begins on Monday, and a monthly pass always begins on the first day of the month.\n\n![An aerial view of the Arc de Triomphe in the evening sunset with many cars on the roads that fan out from this massive landmark](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2020-11/shutterstockRF_1133572007.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## Paris transportation FAQ and things to consider\n\n### Is parking widely available in Paris?\n\nParking in Paris is costly and difficult. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re renting a car to take to the countryside, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pick it up until you are leaving town. And if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re driving your own car, know that to enter the city within the Boulevard P\u00c3\u00a9riph\u00c3\u00a9rique (ring road) between 8am and 8pm Monday to Friday, a [Crit'Air Vignette](https://certificat-air.gouv.fr/) (compulsory anti-pollution sticker) is needed for all cars, motorcycles and trucks registered after\u00a0after January 1,1997, including foreign-registered vehicles. Older vehicles are banned during these hours. The sticker is not necessary for the ring road itself.\n\n### Can I use taxis and rideshare apps?\n\nFind taxis at official stands or via private companies and apps. There are queues of available cabs at major train stations. Paris taxis are expensive but can be a blessing if you have a lot of luggage and can't face the metro steps. Rideshare apps like Uber are active.\n\n### What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best way to get into the city from the airport?\n\nTrains are the best ways to get to and from Paris' airports. The RER B line from Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) crosses under the middle of Paris, with stops that include Gare du Nord, Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet\u00e2\u0080\u0093Les Halles, St-Michel\u00e2\u0080\u0093Notre Dame and Luxembourg. Some trains run express through the suburbs, saving about 10 minutes. An even faster express route is slated for 2027. From Orly Airport, you can connect to the RER B. As of mid-2024, the airport is also served by Line 14 of the metro. A\u00c3\u00a9roport de Beauvais, used by some budget airlines, is a long and slow 75km (47 miles) by bus from Paris.\n\nTaxis and rideshares are also convenient, but can get mired in traffic and become costly.\n\n![A sign reading \"assistance voyageur handicap\u00c3\u00a9\" outside the Paris Tourist Office](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-03/France-Paris-TK-Kurikawa-Shutterstock-1430751035-RFE.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## Paris is working to make its transportation more accessible\n\nParis is an ancient city and therefore not particularly well equipped for visitors with disabilities: curb ramps are few, and older public facilities and the metro are mostly inaccessible for those in a wheelchair (*fauteuil roulant*). Efforts are being made to improve things, however.\n\nParis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 airports are fully in line with international standards for accessibility. Note however that transport to and from the airports may be an issue as many metro stations in the city are not fully accessible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the RATP makes info available through its app and website. Paris buses, however, are all accessible, with low floors and wide doors.\n\nThe SNCF has made many of its train carriages more accessible to people with disabilities, including the RER trains.
