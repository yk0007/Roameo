Reading some of these reviews I can see that many do not realize a few things. And that can lead to frustration. \n\nThe island is large & has many parts.\n\nSo there are three ferry choices Centre, Ward's & Hanlan's. Centre is where the quaint amusement park (younger kids will appreciate )& petting farm is located. And a marina. Ward's includes housing communities and two sit down restaurants. Hanlan's is more remote and includes a nude beach (not everyone partakes so know there are lots of lovely areas here and because not everyone partakes you can be there for hours and many days not see anyone nude. Do not avoid. There are natural barriers to the actual location of the beach location. I went for decades not seeing on nude person. Hanlan's is lovely. \n\nA bike allows you to use any of the ferry locations and schedules. A bike allows for a better experience. There are bikeshare locations right on the island, look it up. But bringing your bike or renting one off island makes for a more peaceful time. Because you are not time limited. The island itself rents bikes at the back of Centre, including quad trolley like bikes. Walking the island is lovely but it is a lot for some. \n\nCrowds, even on the most full day there are areas of the island for tranquility. Just hunt them out.\n\nNow the biggest frustration for some - ferries. I always take them and have been in crazy long lines but am fine with it all. Burt some are not & are not with a few people not being respectful with crowds or waiting in line. I personally find the majority of people gracious. \n\nIf you are not okay with crowds and what happens there are many companies that provide water taxis. They will add to your expense but money equals ease & peace. They are not crazy expensive. But they charge each way, ferries are 'free' back to the city. Some are located father down Queens Quay, around Spadina. Google them. There are many options and locations on the island and city back and forth. For some this option will mean a much better day. \n\nEnjoy everyone. Oh food is not cheap. Not crazy at all, but not cheap. Many families stay for the day and bring food and charcoal to barbeque.

Even better, when you get all the way to the bottom, you get to rock climb back out! (There are ladders in the harder places, if you want the option for those). It's all safely belayed by the guide, and I side-eyed all the anchors since it's a very wet environment, but they have very solidly bolted anchors and well-maintained ropes. \n\nOur guide was so cheerful and honestly fascinated by caves, and he talked just the right amount! You learned a lot (even me, who has heard all the normal \"cave spiels\"!) but you were moving most of the time and didn't feel like it was all \"sitting around being lectured at\" like a schoolroom. His fun accent just made it all the more enjoyable! He was also really great at making complex rope systems seem simple and smoothly checking everyone for safety without slowing down the adventure or feeling like a safety cop. \n\nWe were able to be down in the caves for over 4 hours and explore very far, with gorgeous crystal formations and one neat trick I've never seen done with calcite that I won't spoil here. Just say these guides know a thing or two that cave guides elsewhere don't! The cave itself was scenic and varied with gorgeous formations. I highly recommend renting the cave suit and boots, which make the experience more comfortable. And bless the rental company for having even my weird sizes so I was comfy all day. I run cold, but I found with a base layer, fleece, and the cave suit I was comfortable for 4 hours no problem. Their rubber boots were also way more comfortable to walk in for that long than I would have guessed. \n\nThis cave company thinks of everything! Love their facility, their equipment, and their guides--this will probably be my highlight memory from my whole trip to Vancouver Island!

Although the bulk of visitors cycle, walking is a great option either in/out, or the entire distance. We covered the entire 11.5km in about 3 hours at a moderate pace and had arranged to have someone waiting to pick us up at the end. Doing some pre-visit investigation of the Kettle Valley Railway and Myra Canyon will help you understand more of what you are seeing, but to get a real feel for the massive work done by volunteers to maintain the trail, stop to read the information in the kiosks a couple of kms in from the parking lots (they contain photos of the devastation caused by the 2003 forest fires where 12 of the 18 trestles burned). If you are a Geocacher, there are several caches in the area, but use a GPSr rather than the phone app because cellular coverage is poor.

Mazur Travel/Shutterstock\n\nWhether you\u2019re sipping a spritz in a buzzing plaza or diving into deep blue waters off a rugged coastline, summer in [Europe](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/europe) is incredible. But with more and more people joining the fun, some of [Europe\u2019s best places](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-places-to-visit-europe) also tend to deal with a bit of overcrowding in the [summer high season](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-time-to-visit-europe).\n\nBut don\u2019t let that scare you off a Euro trip this year \u2060\u2013 there are plenty of lesser-explored corners of the continent just waiting to be discovered. Beat the summer heat in the highest stretches of [Scandinavia](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/scandinavia) or find an empty beach on the [Baltic Coast](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/the-baltic-states). Take your vacation where locals go in a lush portion of [Portugal](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/where-locals-go-under-the-radar-destinations-portugal) or flop down on a more relaxed coastline in [Greece](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/discover-where-locals-travel-in-greece).\n\nWhatever your travel style, here are our favorite under-the-radar summer vacation destinations in Europe that are perfect for 2025.\n\n![Image 25: Two adults and a child hike along a path beside a stream in a mountainous region.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/Shutterstock497179633.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nHiking through the Alta Badia valley, Italy. Mostovyi Sergii Igorevich/Shutterstock\n\n1. Alta Badia, Italy\n--------------------\n\n**Best for a mountain getaway**\n\n Advertisement \n\nIf [the Dolomites](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/guide-to-the-dolomites) are the Alps at their most magnificent, the Alta Badia valley in [South Tyrol](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/italy/trentino-alto-adige) promises the Dolomites at their tastiest. This jagged array of deep valleys, high plateaus and piercing pinnacles in northern [Italy](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/italy/) echoes with poignant history: between 1915 and 1918, Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces fought amid these unforgiving peaks, and today you can hike routes such as the Kaiserj\u00e4ger to see their trenches and gun emplacements. Alta Badia is renowned for its skiing, but in summer the cable cars and mountain huts reopen to serve hungry hikers, cyclists, paragliders and trail runners instead \u2013 the region is spangled with Michelin stars, but even simple refuges dish up good-value but top-notch cuisine (think mountain cheeses, pasta and strudels). For an extra adrenaline buzz, tackle the challenging _via ferrata_(\"iron road\") climbs, a method of traversing vertiginous rock faces via rungs and cables.\n\n**Planning tip:**The nearest airports are at Innsbruck, Verona and Venice. La Villa, San Cassiano (St Kassian) and Corvara make excellent bases from which to explore the peaks and valleys.\n\n![Image 26: A village clings to a hill rising from the banks of a river with rugged green hills beyond.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-10/GettyRF489525152.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=1:1&w=450&h=450)\n\n![Image 27: A terracotta bowl filled with sausage, kale and potato soup. ](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-08/GettyImages-553198563.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=4:3&w=800&h=600)\n\n**Left:** The Minho region of Portugal. Sergey Peterman/Getty Images **Right:** Caldo verde, a traditional soup from the Minho region. Westend61/Getty Images\n\n2. Minho, Portugal\n------------------\n\n**Best for foodies**\n\nWhere do the Portuguese take their vacations in Portugal? Those in the know savor staycations in the birthplace of the kingdom: [the northerly Minho region](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/the-minho), a land of verdant hills, traditional culture and fabulous flavors. The Minho is noted for its vinho verde, literally \"green wine\", released just a few months after harvest. As well as those fruity drops (Loureiro and Alvarinho are our picks), the cuisine is delectable, too. There are plenty of local specialties. In Ponte de Lima, Portugal\u2019s oldest town, find a restaurant overlooking the Roman bridge and savor arroz de sarrabulho \u2013 rice cooked in pig\u2019s blood and studded with various pork morsels (tastier than it sounds) \u2013 and caldo verde, a hearty kale soup. Monkfish, sea bass and bream are fish favorites, along with _bacalhau_\u2013 salt cod, a staple throughout the country. Work up an appetite strolling historic towns such as[Braga](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/portugal/the-north/braga), Guimar\u00e3es and Viana do Castelo, where magnificently diverse architecture recalls the wealth of adventurous merchants who made their fortunes during the Age of Discovery and in the subsequent colonial era.\n\n**Trip plan:** Porto is a one-hour train ride from Braga, from where buses serve other towns in the Minho.\n\n![Image 28: A building with a wave-like roof structure and chapel-like entrance at the foot of some mountains.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/Shutterstock2182274447.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nYsios winery, Calatrava. JJFarq/Shutterstock\n\n3. La Rioja, Spain\n------------------\n\n**Best for wine lovers**\n\nThe compact region of [La Rioja](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/la-rioja) somehow crams 500-plus wineries into its modest area, between [Bilbao](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/aragon-basque-country-and-navarra/bilbao), [Zaragoza](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/spain/aragon-basque-country-and-navarra/zaragoza) and [Madrid](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/madrid) in northern [Spain](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/spain/). In summer, the vineyards striping the craggy Ebro River Valley are verdant and lush, and among them you\u2019ll find traces of past settlers \u2013 remains betray inhabitation from Neolithic times, through Moorish occupation to medieval Christian settlement. This is a slow-paced region, rich in history and viticulture: tastings are a must. Visit the venerable, ch\u00e2teau-style wineries clustered around Haro in the Rioja Alta; elsewhere, Rioja Alavesa is more contemporary \u2013 architects Gehry and Calatrava had a hand in the design of Marqu\u00e9s de Riscal and Ysios wineries. Logro\u00f1o, La Rioja\u2019s capital, is packed with bars serving cheap, tasty pintxos (tapas), ideal for soaking up the fruity reds. Summers can be very hot, so plan accordingly.\n\n**Planning tip:** Make a leisurely loop around La Rioja. Visit Haro\u2019s bodegas, head east to Briones for its ruined castle and the lowdown on rioja at Vivanco, and do a pintxos-crawl along Logro\u00f1o\u2019s Calle del Laurel. On the return, stop at medieval Laguardia, below the Sierra de Cantabria; Calatrava\u2019s wave-like Ysios winery is nearby.\n\n![Image 29: A rainbow umbrella is set up on an empty beach washed with blue sea.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-04/Shutterstock1393126436.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=4:3&w=800&h=600)\n\n**Left:** Beach on the Pelion Peninsula.

Pelion Peninsula, Greece\n---------------------------\n\n**Best for a less-crowded Greek holiday**\n\nSure, you could bake on busy beaches on a [Greek island](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-greek-islands). But in sizzling summer, [head instead for cool Pelion](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/greece/pelion-peninsula), the gnarled finger curling into the Aegean to tickle the Sporades. There\u2019s a range of coastal resorts, mostly more isolated and peaceful than elsewhere: try Horto or Milina on the sheltered west coast, southerly Platanias, or busier Horefto, Agios Ioannis and cute Damouhari near beautiful Fakistra beach on the east coast. The mountainous interior oozes natural and cultural appeal \u2013 this is where mythical centaurs came to carouse \u2013 with ancient cobbled paths linking traditional villages where you can admire church frescoes, sip grape-based, rak\u0131-like tsipouro in the shade of venerable plane trees, and savor local specialties such as spetsofa\u00ef (pork-sausage stew), fasoladha (butter bean soup) and lamb in lemon sauce. Up here, the air\u2019s a good few degrees lower than on the coast, and in summer, you can board the narrow-gage Pelion Train that chugs from Ano Lehonia to Milies, running daily in July and August.\n\n**Planning tip:**The nearest airport is in [Thessaloniki](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/greece/northern-greece/thessaloniki), a three-hour bus or train ride from the gateway to the Pelion, Volos. Athens and Preveza are alternatives.\n\n![Image 31: A tent glows with green ligh on the side of a lake, with a sky full of stars above.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-04/GettyImages-1369144701.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nLac Gentau and Pic du Midi d'Ossau on the GR10 trekking route.

Pic du Midi, France\n----------------------\n\n**Best for stargazing**\n\n Advertisement \n\nScan the heavens on a clear night in the summer and you might witness a spectacular light show: the Perseids meteor shower, sparking dozens of shooting stars in the upper atmosphere. The Perseids are active between mid-July and late August each year, peaking around August 12. Head for a dark-sky reserve where you can also admire the Milky Way in between meteors. The [Pic du Midi](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/vallee-des-gaves/attractions/pic-du-midi/a/poi-sig/1233533/1317063), in [the central French Pyrenees,](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/top-things-to-do-in-the-french-pyrenees) is one such reserve, with a historic (now high-spec) observatory at 2877m (9439ft); visit during the day to learn about celestial phenomena and admire the mountain panorama, or at night for an immersive astronomical experience. Even if you don\u2019t make it up to the observatory, this region \u2013 popular with skiers in winter but peaceful in summer \u2013 offers stellar stargazing opportunities, not to mention tremendous hiking: the GR10 long-distance trail meanders nearby. Find a campsite, mountain refuge or apartment in a quiet village, and simply look to the skies.\n\n**Planning tip:** Shuttle buses travel from Lourdes to La Mongie, from where cable cars run up to the observatory. The nearest airports are at Lourdes/Tarbes, Toulouse and Pau.\n\n![Image 32: A spa town with regal buildings at the foot of lush green hills covered in mountain mist.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-04/shutterstock2288778709.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nBad Gastein Spa and Ski Resort in summer. aaddyy/Shutterstock\n\n6. Central Austria\n------------------\n\n**Best for a spa break**\n\nTo find wellness in [Austria](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria), look for the Bad in everything \u2013 at least, in place names: if it starts Bad, it\u2019s a spa town. A dense cluster of saunas, treatment centers and thermal waters studs a broad swathe of central Austria east and south of [Salzburg](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/austria/salzburg), most with a suitably uplifting backdrop of alpine peaks, meadows and valleys. The focus varies subtly from place to place. In Bad Aussee, expect a healthy diet plus outdoor activity, in line with the concepts of Kneipp therapy. The benefits of brine have been promoted in stately Bad Ischl since it received the imperial seal of approval in the mid-19th century. Natural hot springs feed the action at Bad Gastein, with forest bathing and barefoot walking added to the mix in neighboring Bad Hofgastein, which hosts one of Europe\u2019s largest thermal spa complexes. But you won\u2019t want to stay inside during the long, warm days of summer: roam the picturesque paths circling the Salzkammergut\u2019s sparkling lakes, pedal mountain-bike trails above Bad Gastein, or take an invigorating dip in an alpine tarn.\n\n**Planning tip:**Fly or travel by train to Salzburg, from where most spa towns are accessible by bus or train.\n\n![Image 33: An empty sandy beach with forest on one side and ocean on the other.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-04/shutterstock2513285969.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nFind empty beaches along the Baltic Coast, like near Ventspils. marketa1982/Shutterstock\n\n7. Baltic Coast, Latvia\n-----------------------\n\n**Best for empty beaches and national parks**\n\nWith some 300km (187 miles) of largely empty shoreline \u2013 much of it white sand, backed by wooded hills and ridges \u2013 you might wonder why [Latvia\u2019s western coast](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/first-time-guide-to-latvia) isn\u2019t more developed. The answer lies in the communist era, when this was the western Soviet frontier, a strategic area from which locals were squeezed. Today it\u2019s a mesmerizing region to roam on sunny summer days: sometimes somber, sometimes seductive, always spectacular. Coastal settlements range from rapidly gentrifying Ventspils to gritty, grungy Liep\u0101ja (great for alternative music) and a host of small fishing villages studding isolated stretches where you\u2019re sure to find a beach all to yourself. To really get away from it all, head north to [Sl\u012btere National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/baltic-coast-road/attractions/slitere-national-park/a/poi-sig/1464988/1339134) and Kolka, the headland where the Baltic meets the Gulf of R\u012bga. Here, hike or bike among towering dunes, woods and sea, and munch smoked fish bought in traditional fishing villages, such as Vaide, Ko\u0161rags and Mazirbe, where you can also learn about near-extinct Livonian culture.\n\n**Planning tip:** Most visitors arrive on the west coast from [R\u012bga](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/latvia/riga); buses trace the coastline to Kolka and run inland to Ventspils and Liep\u0101ja, but hiring a car makes travel quicker and easier.\n\n![Image 34: A small brown Arctic fox on a summer afternoon surrounded by purple flowers. ](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/shutterstock1117475411.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=1:1&w=450&h=450)\n\n![Image 35: Colorful coal mining houses near the foot of a hill.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/shutterstock2360427975.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=4:3&w=800&h=600)\n\n**Left:** Arctic fox, Svalbard. JoannaPerchaluk / Shutterstock **Right:** Coal mining houses on the hills of Longyearbyen. LouieLea/Shutterstock\n\n8. Svalbard, Norway\n-------------------\n\n**Best for wildlife watching**\n\nIn the high Arctic, the window of opportunity for cruising is open only briefly: the northernmost shores and most [remote fjords of the chilly Svalbard archipelago](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/first-time-guide-to-svalbard) are accessible by sea for only a month or two each summer. But it\u2019s a window worth seeking out. In July, the seas are mostly clear of ice, the temperature \"soars\" to a (relatively) balmy 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) and the sun shines for weeks on end \u2013 morning, noon and (mid)night \u2013 enabling 24-hour sightseeing. Expedition cruise vessels plow past the islands\u2019 jagged mountains and creaking glaciers, while expert guides keep watch for wildlife: walrus colonies, herds of reindeer, Arctic foxes, seals, whales of all sorts and, of course, polar bears. Perhaps 3000 of the huge white predators stalk Svalbard and the surrounding Arctic region; in summer, when the ice breaks up, the bears stay close to the coast. Board a small Zodiac boat and explore the shoreline for the chance of a close encounter.\n\n**Planning tip:** Fly via [Oslo](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/norway/oslo) to Longyearbyen on Spitsbergen, Svalbard\u2019s main island, from where one- or two-week cruises depart; itineraries and activities are dictated by weather and sea conditions.\n\n![Image 36: Sun loungers and umbrellas dot a beach where people are relaxing in the sunshine.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/shutterstock2489143285.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nA beach club in Ksamil on the Albanian Riviera. Hyserb/Shutterstock\n\n9. Albanian Riviera, Albania\n----------------------------\n\n**Best for an under-the-radar beach break**\n\nWhile not quite the hidden gem that it was at the turn of the millennium, when empty beaches and truly bargain prices abounded, [Albania](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/albania)\u2019s glorious southern shoreline remains a treat for those in search of sun, sand and seafood. Saranda is now a fully fledged party town, its esplanade lined with bars. For quieter resorts, head up the coast to Himara, flanked by a scattering of [good beaches](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/best-beaches-in-albania) (try Potami, just to the south). In summer, you\u2019re guaranteed sun, balmy water and hot tweather; unsurprisingly, loungers and beach umbrellas are at a premium but you can still seek out peaceful patches of sand at spots such as Palasa, Borsh, pebbly Bunec and the islands off Ksamil. Or head over to the epic Llogara Pass to Vlora Bay, where you\u2019ll find more resorts and boat trips to isolated beaches at the end of the Karaburuni Peninsula. For a break from sand-lolling, head to the archaeological site of [Butrint](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/albania/the-albanian-riviera/attractions/butrint/a/poi-sig/1005319/1324728), where Greek, Roman and Byzantine ruins, some dating back 2500 years, are crammed onto a knobbly headland.\n\n**Planning tip:**From Corfu, which receives international fights and ferries from the Italian port of Brindisi, daily fast ferries reach the main city of Saranda in 30 minutes.\n\n![Image 37: A ferry traveling along beside a forest-covered island.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/shutterstock1548260474.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=4:3&w=800&h=600)\n\n**Left:** A ferry in the Stockholm archipelago.

Stockholm Archipelago, Sweden\n---------------------------------\n\n**Best for an island break**\n\nLess a city, more a wooded archipelago that happens to host some important buildings, [Sweden\u2019s capital](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/sweden/stockholm) is unreasonably attractive \u2013 and never more so than in sunny summer, when the sun glints on the water and the many parks beckon. Stockholm has enough cultural attractions to pack several days, from the cobbled alleys of [Gamla Stan](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/sweden/stockholm/gamla-stan) (Old Town) to exceptional contemporary galleries and museums (including open-air [Skansen](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/sweden/stockholm/djurgarden-skeppsholmen/attractions/skansen/a/poi-sig/406824/1341999)), while the sleek modern shopping district of Nordmalm offers ample welcoming cafes and restaurants for the all-important fika (coffee and cake break). It\u2019s easy to roam the 14 main islands on foot, by bike or metro, but there are tens of thousands more islets and rocks in the archipelago that are best explored by ferry, on a boat cruise or \u2013 better yet \u2013 by kayak. Watch for ospreys, beavers and grey seals in various choice spots around the archipelago.\n\n**Planning tip:**Even in summer, bring warm layers for evenings, when temperatures can drop to 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F). Things get quieter after the Swedish school summer holidays end in the second half of August.\n\n![Image 39: A beautiful sandy beach and rocky coastline. ](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-04/shutterstock2198520695.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=1:1&w=450&h=450)\n\n![Image 40: A bottlenose dolphin jumps high from the ocean with cliffs in the distance.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-04/shutterstock2232673829.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=4:3&w=800&h=600)\n\n**Left:** Cardigan Bay, Wales. Shutterstock / Richard Whitcombe **Right:** A bottlenose dolphin in Cardigan Bay. Karl Weller/Shutterstock\n\n11. Cardigan Bay, Wales\n-----------------------\n\n**Best for sea life**\n\nThe coast of west [Wales](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/wales) is a popular destination \u2013 for marine mammals as well as holidaying humans. In summer, the broad sweep of Cardigan Bay hosts Europe\u2019s largest population of bottlenose dolphins, some resident, others seasonal visitors, and numbering around 300 individuals. They\u2019re not shy, and as summer warms up, a boat trip offers a healthy chance of enjoying a close encounter, especially likely offshore of Cemaes Head or New Quay; hop on board from one of the attractive harbors at the southern end of the bay. The fun doesn\u2019t end with dolphins: grey seals haul out on rocks, and you might also spot harbor porpoises and seabirds such as guillemots and razorbills. On land, explore the Dylan Thomas connections at New Quay, roam ancient castles and churches, and fuel up on local treats \u2013 seafood, of course, but also excellent artisan cheeses.\n\n**Planning tip:**Base yourself in one of Ceredigion\u2019s postcard-pretty coastal towns \u2013 New Quay, Aberaeron or Llangrannog \u2013 and spend a few days exploring. The Cardigan to Aberystwyth section (97km/60 miles) of the coastal path makes an achievable four- or five-day adventure.\n\n![Image 41: People wander through a city square lined with tall townhouses](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-04/GettyImages-1399548275.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nSquare of the Cathedral, Antwerp, in summertime. StefanoZaccaria/Getty Images\n\n12. Antwerp, Belgium\n--------------------\n\n**Best for a cultural city break**\n\nMany things in [Antwerp](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/belgium/flanders/antwerp), the thrumming historical hub of the Low Countries, are high: the culture, the fashion and, in many respects, the prices. Fortunately, summer offers a respite for your wallet via Zomer van Antwerpen (Antwerp Summer), a diverse and densely packed calendar of music, dance, theater and circus performances that takes over the city from late June through August \u2013 many events are free, while others charge \"democratic\" (ie bargain) prices. Of course, there\u2019s plenty more to pack into a short break: Rubens' masterworks in [his house-museum](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/belgium/flanders/antwerp/attractions/rubenshuis/a/poi-sig/425633/358710) and within the spectacular [Onze-Lieve Vrouwekathedraal](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/belgium/flanders/antwerp/attractions/onze-lieve-vrouwekathedraal/a/poi-sig/425595/358710); city-wide medieval and art nouveau architectural gems; hedonistic clubs and summer pop-up bars in parks and along the river. Long renowned as a trading center for diamonds and, more recently, cutting-edge fashion, Antwerp offers dangerously addictive shopping, too.\n\n**Planning tip:**Antwerp\u2019s spectacular fin-de-si\u00e8cle [Central Station](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/belgium/flanders/antwerp/attractions/antwerpen-centraal/a/poi-sig/425573/358710) is a destination in itself \u2013 arrive by train if possible (easy, with ample services from across Europe, many via Brussels). The airport is just 5km (3 miles) southeast of the city center.\n\n![Image 42: Kayaks on a turquoise river lined by woodland.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/shutterstockRF186784328.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=1:1&w=450&h=450)\n\n![Image 43: Two cyclists pedal along a boardwalk over lakes in a mountainous region.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2025-03/Shutterstock2319639083.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop&ar=4:3&w=800&h=600)\n\n**Left:** Kayaking on the So\u010da River in Triglav National Park. Michael Thaler/Shutterstock **Right:** Cycling along Lake Jezero Jasna in Triglav National Park. Umomos/Shutterstock\n\n13. Julian Alps, Slovenia\n-------------------------\n\n**Best for outdoor adventures**\n\nIn [Slovenia](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/slovenia/), a land of spectacular mountains, lakes and rivers, and one of Europe\u2019s most forested countries, it\u2019s no coincidence that Slovenes are so keen on outdoor activities. And [the Julian Alps](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/slovenia/the-julian-alps), where the 2684m (8806ft) Mt Triglav is surrounded by 840 sq km (324 sq miles) of national park, are the focus of this action. Summer is a great time to get outside, whether swimming in picture-perfect lakes [Bled](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/slovenia/julian-alps/bled) or [Bohinj](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/slovenia/julian-alps/bohinj), rafting the So\u010da River or canyoning the Grme\u010dica gorge. Hiking is also huge here: it\u2019s said that every Slovenian should climb Triglav at least once, but you could also dip into the low-level, circular Julian Alps Trail, totalling 260km (162 miles) and affording tremendous views of the peaks, plus access to village accommodation, cultural insights and places to fuel up on excellent Slovenian cuisine and wines \u2013 universally high in quality but low in price.\n\n**Planning tip:** Fly to [Ljubljana](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/slovenia/ljubljana) or [Venice](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinations/italy/venice) (an easy drive west), then either tackle some of the Julian Alps Trail or explore from a handy base \u2013 Kobarid or Bovec for the So\u010da Valley, Kranjska Gora or Mojstrana for the Sava Valley, or any of the settlements in the Bohinj Valley.\n\n Advertisement \n\n Advertisement \n\n Advertisement \n\nGet a book.

Even virtually unknown destinations are now just a search away on Google, and they probably have an active Instagram feed. The only round-the-world challenge left involves travelling on a pogo stick - backwards. Someone, somewhere has already trodden the most remote nooks, crannies and mountaintops; and those places also have decent wi-fi.\n\nBut take heart, adventurer: the beautiful thing about travel isn't that you're the first or best or even the worst; it's the personal discovery, growth and fulfilment you glean on the way. You may be the 119,837,857th person to lay eyes on Pompeii, but what counts is how this experience affects and shapes you as an individual.\n\nWhat follows is a small selection of history's bravest, most determined, craziest adventurers. You'll probably never be as interesting as them, but that doesn't mean you can't ape their adventures and make them - in some sense - your own.\n\n### Erik the Red/Leif Ericson\n\n**Noteworthy adventures:** Settled [Greenland](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/greenland) and (briefly) [North America](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/north-america).\n\nBack when a lot of people still suspected that sailing off into the unknown might end with them dropping off the edge of a flat Earth or blundering into a dragon's lair, it must have taken nerves of steel for this Norwegian father/son duo to blaze a trail to Greenland and North America.\n\nThat said, Erik the Red had little choice but to flee [Iceland](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/iceland) and become the first European settler on Greenland in 986 AD because of the murderous fallout of his bad temper. Travel/exploration as a result of banishment ran in the family \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Erik's father washed up in Iceland after being invited to leave [Norway](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/norway) for similar reasons.\n\nLeif Ericson, who broke with tradition by murdering no one, pushed further west to find 'Vinland' (known today as Newfoundland), which another merchant sailor had reported sighting after being blown off course. Leif reached land and helped establish settlements around 1000 AD, which were used as a base for shipping timber back to Greenland. For a variety of reasons, all the settlements were abandoned after only a few years.\n\n**Emulate them:** Whether or not you've been banished from your home country, journeying through Newfoundland and Greenland can be an otherworldly, enriching experience even today.\n\n### Ferdinand Magellan\n\n**Noteworthy adventures:** Organized the first circumnavigation of Earth.\n\nWhile acting on a disastrous hunch about a shorter, westerly route from [Europe](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/europe) to the Spice Islands in [Indonesia](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia), Portuguese-born Magellan inadvertently organized the first circumnavigation of the Earth. He doesn't get much credit, though. This is because he and most of his crew didn't complete the journey thanks to mutiny - and associated punitive executions - abandonment, wars, disease, and starvation.\n\nThe journey was eventually completed by forgiven mutineer Juan Sebasti\u00c3\u00a1n Elcano after Magellan was killed in the [Philippines](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/philippines). Of the five ships and 270 men that set off from [Seville](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain/seville) in August of 1519, only one beat-up, spice-laden ship carrying just 18 men from the original crew limped back to [Spain](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/spain) in September 1522. Other abandoned stragglers eventually made their way home, bringing the survivor count to roughly 38.\n\nThough he didn't get the fame, fortune and shortcut to the Spice Islands that he envisioned, Magellan's mission greatly expanded Europe's knowledge of the world, including the accidental discovery of the Pacific Ocean, and revealed how the planet was quite a bit larger than anyone had previously suspected. Also, though it had long been suggested that the Earth was probably not flat, this misadventure was the first empirical proof of a spherical world.\n\n**Emulate him:** A round-the-world sailing trip is never dull or ordinary. And if the potential for mutiny, abandonment, wars, disease, and starvation fits your idea of adventure travel, you can always book a couple of flights on a budget airline.\n\n### Ibn Battuta\n\n**Noteworthy adventures:** Clocked up an impressive 73,000 miles during the 14th century.\n\nWhile most of the people listed here traveled with a pretty specific goal in mind, Ibn Battuta just had the urge to wander. And boy did he do that.\n\nA Berber from [Morocco](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco), Battuta originally left home to undertake a meandering pilgrimage to Mecca. From there, he just kept on going. Over nearly 30 years (1325-1354) he traveled some 73,000 miles, visiting [Cairo](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/cairo), Mogadishu, the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Constantinople, Bulgaria, Central Asia, [India](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india), Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Indonesia, Vietnam, Beijing, [Sardinia](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/sardinia), Spain, Timbuktu and then back home without, obviously, the help of any motorized transport. He stopped frequently to work, rub shoulders with the rich, famous and powerful of the era, marry a few no doubt long-suffering ladies, stumble into various adventures/trouble and recover from what must have been some truly horrific bouts of traveler's diarrhea.\n\nAccounts of Battuta's travels - dictated from memory as he didn't keep a journal - were later published in the Rihla ('The Journey').\n\n**Emulate him:** Overland, self-powered travel is a small but inherently badass niche. Even short trips can be fulfilling and inspire awe from friends and bystanders.\n\n### Nellie Bly\n\n**Noteworthy adventures:** First 'almost unchaperoned' round-the-world trip by a woman.\n\nAt the age of 25, celebrated journalist Elizabeth Jane Cochrane, writing under the pen name Nellie Bly, set out on 14 November, 1889, to emulate Jules Verne's fictional character Phileas Fogg in *Around the World in Eighty Days*. She completed the (obviously) overland trip on 25 January 1890, in a world-record time of 72 days, six hours, 11 minutes and 14 seconds. (Her record was broken by some killjoy man just a few months later.) Bly traveled 'with nothing but the dress on her back, a heavy coat, a few pairs of underwear, and a small bag carrying her toiletries'.\n\nBly's easterly route via steamships and railways started in New Jersey, went through [England](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/england), France (where she actually met Jules Verne), down to Brindisi, [Italy](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy), through the Suez Canal, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, [China](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/china) and Japan before landing on US soil in San Francisco and completing the trip on a chartered private train back to New Jersey.\n\n**Emulate her:** Overland, round-the-world trips are infinitely more comfortable these days, but that doesn't mean they aren't ambitious and fulfilling.\n\n### Dervla Murphy\n\n**Noteworthy adventures:** self-supported bike trip from [Ireland](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/ireland) to India in 1963.\n\nMurphy started what would be decades of tireless adventure travel and writing with this pedal-powered quest, which took her through the teeth of Europe during an especially bad winter, followed by Iran, [Afghanistan](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/afghanistan), and Pakistan. Armed with a near imperviousness to discomfort, a disregard for personal safety, and a .25 pistol, which was put to use fending off hungry wolves in Bulgaria and 'lecherous Kurds in Persia', she achieved her objective mostly unscathed and wrote about the adventure in the memoir *Full Tilt: Ireland to India With a Bicycle*.\n\n**Emulate her:** Travel by bike is a surefire way to get a more intimate look at destinations and cultures.\n\nFor Explorers Everywhere\n\n### Follow us\n\n### SUBSCRIBE\n\n### Get 20% off your first order.\n\nSubscribe to Lonely Planet newsletters and promotions.
