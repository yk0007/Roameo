Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sampling of places overlooked because of geography, chance and the presence of more glamorous neighbours.\n\n### 1. Trieste, Italy\n\n![Trieste lighthouse.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2023-05/shutterstock2111411972.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nWhy isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this anomalous Italian city top of a must-visit list? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cultural melting pot, on a sea-thrusting prong of land, almost in [Slovenia](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/slovenia). It was the key port of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and retains an enticing, elegiac sense of the past. Former resident James Joyce began writing Ulysses not in [Dublin](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/ireland/dublin), but here. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of Hapsburg splendour, from its Viennese cafes and central European cuisine to its sweeping neo-classical waterfront.\n\n### 2. Arras, France\n\nWith its two Flemish-Spanish squares, lined by 155 gingerbread-like houses, Arras is an astonishing surprise in an oft-forgotten corner of northern France. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth planning to spend the day here, so you can admire the 17th and 18th architectural confectionery, climb the elegant bell tower for big views, and wander through the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarkable 22km-long underground tunnels, which were used by soldiers during WWI.\n\n### 3. Gujarat, India\n\nIndia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northwestern state of Gujarat is not on most travellers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 itineraries, but if you have time it rewards exploration. Besides a friendly welcome, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll experience an off-beat allure: the laid-back ex-Portuguese island of Diu; the city of Bhuj, with an evocative dilapidated palace and surrounding craft-rich villages; and the otherworldly salt plains of the Little Rann of Kutch, populated by flamingos and the Indian wild ass.\n\n### 4. Ch\u00c3\u00b3ngq\u00c3\u00acng, China\n\nOften bypassed in favour of neighbouring [S\u00c3\u00acchu\u00c4\u0081n](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/sichuan), Ch\u00c3\u00b3ngq\u00c3\u00acng is worthy of more attention, with its imposing location overlooking the Yangzi River and conversation-stalling spicy food. Modern China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s futuristic cityscape contrasts with the clutter of old steel boats at the docks and the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 'bangbang' army of porters who suspend goods on stout bamboo poles, transporting anything and everything over its steep hills.\n\n### 5. Aberdeen, Scotland\n\nThe granite town of Aberdeen is home to a stately university centred on the 15th-century King\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chapel, is fronted by a long sandy beach, and contains the time-capsule, Hobbit-quaint fishing village of Footdee. And beyond the stern, glittering city, you can take a dreamy coastal train trip to see Castle Dunottar, the awe-inspiring cliff-edge ruin where Franco Zefferelli filmed Hamlet.\n\n### 6. Utrecht, The Netherlands\n\n![Utrecht, Bicycle parked in bicycle rack in front of house.](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-09/GettyImages-614081960.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\nPerhaps it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the lure of [Amsterdam](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-netherlands/amsterdam) that leads people to forget Utrecht. Whatever the reason, this graceful city is bizarrely under-visited. Its old town is encircled by a medieval canal, and you can hop on a boat tour to visit the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bustling, vibrant wharves. Built to connect the canalside with Utrecht\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impressive townhouses, today these unique spaces are filled with bohemian cafes, shops, restaurants and bars.\n\n### 7. Mekn\u00c3\u00a8s, Morocco\n\nEveryone knows [Marrakesh](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/marrakesh) and [F\u00c3\u00a8s](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/the-mediterranean-coast-and-the-rif/fes), but who takes the time to stop off in lesser-known Mekn\u00c3\u00a8s? On a smaller scale than its more famous siblings, this ancient imperial city has a low key, laid-back feel, yet an architectural and cultural bounty of 45km of walls, nearly 50 palaces, and nearby, the plateau-top Roman ruins of [Volubilis](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/sights/archaeological-site/volubilis).\n\n### 8. Helsinki, Finland\n\nThe small Finnish capital, continental Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northernmost city, looks out into the shimmering Baltic, and several of its major sights sit on islands, such as the 18th-century fortress of [Suomenlinna](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/finland/helsinki/suomenlinna). This unassuming yet charismatic capital retains glorious art nouveau buildings and 1930s restaurants, and is notably clean, tidy and well behaved. It also comes alive when the sun shines - almost all night from June to August.\n\n### 9. Jerez de la Frontera, Spain\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rarely chilly, usually either balmy or baking, in this lovely, off-the-track Andalucian town, which is famous for its sherry production. There are many ornate churches, an imposing citadel, plus multiple bodegas where you can taste Jerez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most famous export. This is also the flamenco heartland, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the best places in Spain to experience authentic performances of this most passionate art.\n\n### 10. Takayama, Japan\n\nLocals recommend that you take a trip to the less-travelled 'other' side of the main Honshu island to gain a sense of old Japan. Those who make it out here will discover Takayama, a small city dotted by morning markets, sake breweries, and hillside shrines, and nearby Shirakawa-go, famous for its traditional gassho-zukuri - farmhouses-on-stilts - and countryside that looks like a Nihonga (traditional Japanese) painting.\n\nYearning for classic sights or off-the-beaten track experiences?

What you might not know is that its underground adventures are just as incredible, with an astounding 4,800 known caves in the state.

The book celebrates 100 of the continent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most underrated destinations, including the wilds of Alaska\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remote Dalton Highway and Mayan ruins hidden on the tip of Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Yucat\u00c3\u00a1n Peninsula. North America, as it turns out, still has plenty of secrets that remain untold.\n\nThe place I personally couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait to write about was [Grasslands National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/val-marie/attractions/grasslands-national-park/a/poi-sig/1361667/1335248) in southern Saskatchewan. While [Banff National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/alberta/banff-and-jasper-national-parks) gets all the glory and over four million visitors per year thanks to its obvious good looks, Grasslands is home to one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rarest ecosystems: mixed-grass prairies. Sure, it might not have Banff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glaciers or sublime blue lakes, but the waving grasses, roaming bison and chirping prairie dogs all lend to a sublime kind of beauty \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one that only about 20,000 visitors per year will experience.\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for more crowd-free alternatives to some of North America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most popular vacation spots, here are just eight of the book\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entries, each highlighting how vast and varied our continent truly is.\n\n![shutterstock2077112419-RFC.jpg](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-05/shutterstock2077112419-RFC.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 1. Tulsa, Oklahoma\n\n**Make this charming midwestern city your next city break**\n\nPropose a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccity break,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll inevitably be presented with the same tried-and-true options, with cosmopolitan heavyweights like New York, Montr\u00c3\u00a9al, Los Angeles and New Orleans being the top competitors. But we have an unlikely contender to add to the ring: Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nFor over 100 years, its primary industry has been oil, the profits from which have played a major role in shaping Tulsa into a vibrant Midwest city worthy of your next long weekend. Take, for example, its extensive collection of lavishly built Art Deco buildings, dating back to the 1920s. Then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tulsa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well-funded art and cultural institutions. Museums like the [Philbrook](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/great-plains/tulsa/attractions/philbrook-museum-of-art/a/poi-sig/1132001/361966) and [Gilcrease](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/great-plains/tulsa/attractions/gilcrease-museum/a/poi-sig/1131998/361966) stack up against those found in bigger cities, while new additions include the [Greenwood Rising](https://www.greenwoodrising.org/) museum (which examines the 1921 race-based attack on the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack Wall Street\u00e2\u0080\u009d), the [Woody Guthrie Center](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/great-plains/tulsa/attractions/woody-guthrie-center/a/poi-sig/1410340/361966) and the new-in-2022 [Bob Dylan Center](https://bobdylancenter.com/). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all rounded out by a lively music scene (concert venues include [Cain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ballroom](https://www.cainsballroom.com/), a car-garage-turned-venue), [craft breweries](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/where-to-drink-in-tulsa-oklahoma) and excellent walking tours of its historic neighborhoods.\n\n**Getting there:** Tulsa International Airport is the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main gateway, with nonstop flights from several US destinations. To explore, the city is best navigated by foot, rideshare or bikeshare.\n\n**When to go:** September to November, when Tulsa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weather is at its most temperate.\n\n**Pro tip:** For a deep dive into Tulsa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historic neighborhoods or its Art Deco architecture, book a customized walking tour with [Tours of Tulsa.](https://toursoftulsa.com/)\n\n![shutterstock_554815849.jpg](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2023-04/shutterstock_554815849.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 2. Moloka\u00e2\u0080\u0098i, Hawaii\n\n**Hawaii\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friendly isle offers unspoiled nature and flourishing culture**\n\nIn recent years, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a call to reconsider holidaying in [Hawaii](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/hawaii), as locals and sustainability experts alike express concerns that the nine million annual visitors are harming the archipelago\u00e2\u0080\u0099s culture and environment. But if Hawaii has been on your wish list for a long time, a considered approach is to explore one of its less-frequented islands.\n\nDespite being the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth largest island, fewer than 30 tourists a day arrive on [Moloka\u00e2\u0080\u0099i](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/hawaii/moloka-i) during the summer months. The tiny island \u00e2\u0080\u0093 only 38 miles long and 10 miles across at its widest point \u00e2\u0080\u0093 doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have luxury resorts, trendy bars, big-box retailers or chain restaurants. Heck, there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even traffic lights, and cell phone reception can be spotty at times. But those who make the journey will be rewarded with long sandy beaches with nary another soul in sight, uncrowded hiking trails through old-growth rainforests and rich culture absent of plastic leis.\n\n**Getting there:** Mokulele Air is the only commercial airline that services Moloka\u00e2\u0080\u0099i, providing nonstop service from O\u00ca\u00bbahu, Maui and Hawai\u00ca\u00bbi Island aboard nine-seater Cessna planes. Once there, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need a rental car to get around, as there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no public transit, and taxi services are limited.\n\n**When to go:** May to October. Spring brings an end to the rainy season, with cooling trade winds and daylong sunshine carrying into autumn.\n\n**Pro tip:** Bring cash. Not all shops and restaurants on the island accept credit cards.\n\n![shutterstockRF294722000.jpg](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-05/shutterstockRF294722000.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 3. John Day Region, Oregon\n\n**A diverse biosphere in Central Oregon deserves center stage**\n\nFrom the moment you first see a photo of the [John Day Region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Painted Hills](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/oregon/john-day-fossil-beds-national-monument/attractions/painted-hills-unit/a/poi-sig/1356342/1324648) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a kaleidoscope of yellows, golds, blacks and reds, reminiscent of Peru\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vinicunca (Rainbow Mountain) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be left wondering how much longer it will stay a relative secret.\n\nBut the stunning claystone formations aren't the only geological feature that make this region worth visiting. A range of diverse landscapes is packed into a relatively compact and easy-to-navigate area. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find the old-growth rainforests that [Oregon](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/pacific-northwest/oregon) is famous for; canyons similar to those in the Southwest; high-desert plains not unlike those in Big Sky country; and Oregon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longest undammed river, with sandy beaches and lush meadows on its shores.\n\nAccording to writer Joshua Samuel Brown, who submitted this entry to Offbeat North America: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d need to visit every state west of the Rockies to experience the breadth of terrain encompassed in the John Day Region.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n**Getting there:** The John Day Region is situated roughly a five-hour drive southeast of Portland. Alternately, it can be accessed from Bend by bus, with Grant County Transportation operating buses between Bend and Prairie City three times a week.\n\n**When to go:** April to October. For wildflowers in bloom, visit in spring or early summer. Otherwise, aim for the shoulder seasons, when there are fewer visitors and the weather is cooler.\n\n**Pro tip:** Pack a trowel. The hill behind Wheeler High School in the aptly named town of Fossil is a designated digging spot for amateur paleontologists. Admission is $5.\n\n![shutterstock2145331655-RFE.jpg](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-05/shutterstock2145331655-RFE.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 4. Alamosa, Colorado\n\n**Wedged between high peaks and serene wildlife refuges, this low-key town proves the truth is out there**\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no question that [Colorado](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/rocky-mountains/colorado) is best known for its ski resorts and mountain vistas \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but the Centennial State isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a one-trick pony. Head due south from the long lift lines and crowded trailheads near Vail, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll arrive in Alamosa, an high-altitude agricultural community.\n\nIf there was a Venn diagram for Alamosa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s typical tourists, they would overlap in their shared love of flying objects. In addition to being a hub for UFO sightings and a major pathway for migratory birds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including the 20,000 sandhill cranes that arrive every spring \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Alamosa offers plenty on the ground, too. Its streets are lined with boutiques, antique shops and craft breweries, while it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a 30-minute drive from the [Great Sand Dunes National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/colorado/the-san-luis-valley/attractions/great-sand-dunes-national-park/a/poi-sig/1120279/1336799), home to the tallest sand dunes in North America.\n\n**Getting there:** The closest to Alamosa is New Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Albuquerque International Airport. Hire a car to reach your destination, which will take roughly 3.5 hours.\n\n**When to go:** June to August. Patio season is meant for sipping Alamosa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s craft brews, while providing ideal weather for exploring both the San Luis valley and the nearby Sangre de Cristo mountains.\n\n**Pro tip:** Give yourself time to acclimatize. Alamosa sits at 7544ft above sea level, so stay hydrated to avoid the effects of altitude sickness.\n\n![shutterstock1035035407-RFC.jpg](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-05/shutterstock1035035407-RFC.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 5. Ice Age Trail, Wisconsin\n\n**Hike through glacier-carved landscapes on this long-distance trek**\n\nHiking trails typically don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t conjure up images of overtourism, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an ever-pressing concern in wilderness environments. Popular thru-hikes like the [Pacific Crest Trail](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/pacific-crest-trail-new-permit-rules) (PCT) even employ lottery systems for permits, all in a bid to limit foot traffic.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Wisconsin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s [Ice Age Trail](https://www.iceagetrail.org/) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a 1,200-mile trail zigzagging across the state \u00e2\u0080\u0093 might be worth considering first. While still a work in-progress (it includes connecting trails and country roads), it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s less strenuous and shorter than the PCT or the Appalachian Trail. And thus far, less than 500 people have hiked it in entirety, meaning there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still bragging rights up for grabs.\n\nIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have that much time to spare, opt for the 600-mile \u00e2\u0080\u009cIce Age\u00e2\u0080\u009d segment, which carries hikers through wooded hills and glittering lakes formed by an ancient glacier. Along the way, camp trailside or stay in small communities, helping to support the livelihoods of the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s locals.\n\n**Getting there:** The easiest trailhead to access is the western end, in St Croix Falls, Minnesota, about 55 miles from [Minneapolis](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/great-lakes/minneapolis). The trail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trickier-to-reach eastern end is in [Potawatomi State Park](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/potawatomi) in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. From either spot you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need wheels to reach the trailheads.\n\n**When to go:** April to October. Although winter is the trail\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quietest time, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also when portions close due to hunting seasons. Instead, opt for spring or autumn, when insects and temperatures are both more manageable.\n\n**Pro tip:** The Ice Age Trail may be less trafficked than its more famous contemporaries, but it still has its fair share of trail angels, who provide support in the form of shuttles, lodging and showers. [The Ice Age Trail Alliance](https://www.iceagetrail.org/) has contact information for these volunteers.\n\n![iStock-823676764-RFC.jpg](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-05/iStock-823676764-RFC.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 6. Alabama\n\n**An unlikely destination for underground outdoor adventures**\n\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a member of the paddling community, you probably know that [Alabama](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/the-south/alabama) offers some of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best canoeing and kayaking, [with 6,300 miles of accessible waterways](https://www.alabamascenicrivertrail.com/). What you might not know is that its underground adventures are just as incredible, with an astounding 4,800 known caves in the state. (Jackson County, in the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northeast corner, has the most caves per mile in the entire US.)\n\nSome caves are easy to explore and others require specialized spelunking skills, but each is more spectacular than the last. In the [Dismals Cave](https://www.dismalscanyon.com/), you can stare up in awe at the phosphorescence of glowworms. In [Rickwood Caverns State Park](https://www.alapark.com/parks/rickwood-caverns-state-park), you can swim in an Olympic-sized pool fed with cave water. [Manitou Cave](https://www.manitoucaveofal.org/) contains inscriptions from the Cherokee Nation on a 50-foot-high ceiling, written over 200 years ago. And during summer evenings, more than 250,000 bats can be seen emerging from [Sauta Cave](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/sauta-cave). With adventures like these, Alabama might just be the most \u00e2\u0080\u009cunderground\u00e2\u0080\u009d destination in the book.\n\n**Getting there:** Alabama has three major airports: [Huntsville](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/north-alabama-huntsville-city-outdoors), [Birmingham](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/the-south/birmingham) and Montgomery. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also well connected by road to major cities like [Atlanta](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/the-south/atlanta), [Nashville](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/nashville) and [New Orleans](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/new-orleans). No matter how you get here, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need a car to get around.\n\n**Best time to visit:** May to October. Despite the summer heat, temperatures inside the caves stay the same year-round, with summer being the best chance to see bats in flight.\n\n**Pro tip:** Plot our your cave visits in advance, as even some of the most sought-after caves (including Sauta Cave Wildlife Reserve and Manitou Cave) may not have dining or restrooms nearby.\n\n![White-bison-Metis-Crossing-Alberta-credit-Jessica-Lockhart.jpg](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-05/White-bison-Metis-Crossing-Alberta-credit-Jessica-Lockhart.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 7. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUkrainian Bloc,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alberta\n\n**Outrageous roadside attractions in Alberta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offbeat cultural mosaic**\n\nFans of \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiant Things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d we see you. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no shortage of them northeast of [Edmonton, Alberta](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/alberta/edmonton), where the roadside attractions follow a definite theme: There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Vegreville\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giant pysanka (Ukrainian Easter egg), Glendon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giant perogy (Ukrainian dumplings, also spelled pierogi) and Mundare\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giant kovbasa (Ukrainian sausage). Around the turn of the century, this pocket of the prairies was home to the largest colony of Ukrainian settlers in Canada.\n\nIts Eastern European heritage is still evident in the metallic domes of the Ukrainian churches dotting the countryside and celebrated at attractions like the [Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village](http://ukrainianvillage.ca/). However, until recently, a lack of accommodation meant that visitors typically just drove on through \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer the case, thanks to [M\u00c3\u00a9tis Crossing](https://metiscrossing.com/). Over the last two years, the cultural center has opened a boutique lodge and stargazing domes on the edge of the North Saskatchewan River, the latter a perfect vantage point from which to watch the northern lights dance at night.\n\n**Getting there:** The Ukrainian Bloc doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have defined boundaries, but most communities run alongside Highways 16 and 28 east and northeast of Edmonton. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need a car to get to the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village (a 30-mile drive east of Edmonton), while M\u00c3\u00a9tis Crossing is a 75-mile drive northeast.\n\n**Best time to visit:** May to October. Some attractions, including the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village, are only open seasonally from late May until early September, so check opening hours in advance.\n\n**Pro tip:** Bring a cooler to stock up on food made by the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s babas. Smoky Lake\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bakery stocks bags of frozen pierogies and borscht (beet soup). Similarly, Stawnichy in Mundare sells freezer packs of cabbage rolls, kielbasa sausage rings and perishke (cheese buns).\n\n![iStock-643836364-RFC.jpg](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2024-05/iStock-643836364-RFC.jpg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 8. Ruta Puuc Yucat\u00c3\u00a1n, Mexico\n\n**Discover ancient Maya architecture on a less-explored Yucat\u00c3\u00a1n route**\n\nAs one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d seven wonders of the world, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to understand why more than 2.5 million visitors flock to [Chich\u00c3\u00a9n Itz\u00c3\u00a1](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/visiting-chichen-itza-mexico) every year. But only about 40,000 will collectively make it to Labn\u00c3\u00a1, Sayil and Xlapak, three Maya sites that are part of the wider [Uxmal Unesco World Heritage site.](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/mexico/yucatan-peninsula/south-of-merida/attractions/uxmal-ruins/a/poi-sig/501740/1330303)\n\nNestled in the hilly Puuc region, south of [M\u00c3\u00a9rida](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/mexico/yucatan-peninsula/merida), these richly adorned archeological sites mark a high point in Maya architecture. With its monumental arch, elaborate carvings and temple-topped pyramid, Labn\u00c3\u00a1 is the highlight for many, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a special kind of magic in stumbling across a half-lost building at Sayil, hidden in the forest. Along the way, stop to cool off in sparkling cenotes or sample Yucatecan food.\n\n**Getting there:** The route begins 70 miles south of M\u00c3\u00a9rida (a 90-minute drive), where a smaller road branches off Hwy 261 toward Sayil then continues on to Xlapak and Labn\u00c3\u00a1. Guided tours are also available from M\u00c3\u00a9rida.\n\n**Best time to visit:** September to April. Skip the hot, humid summer months. From September onwards, the weather cools down and the crowds thin out.\n\n**Pro tip:** Time your visit for when the sites open at 8am. Chances are, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be one of the only visitors in the cool morning air.\n\nFor Explorers Everywhere\n\n### Follow us\n\n### SUBSCRIBE\n\n### Get 20% off your first order.\n\nSubscribe to Lonely Planet newsletters and promotions.

      "content": "## 5. Nevis, St Kitts and Nevis\n\nBest for hikers\n\nNevis, in the Leeward Islands, is one of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best kept secrets. The smaller of the dual-island nation of St Kitts and Nevis, its mystique is the inactive volcano, mountains, often shrouded in mist, and the Nevis Peak at more than 975m (3200ft). The beaches are beautiful and uncrowded where wild donkeys, goats, and green vervet monkeys roam. Take an adventurous climb up Mt Nevis or a less intense hike to rainforest waterfalls. [...] A lush green coastline with a small village of houses\n\n## 2. Bluefields, Jamaica\n\nBest for solitude\n\nWhen you think Jamaica, Montego Bay and Negril probably come to mind. Skip the masses and head to Bluefields on the south coast instead. You can still arrange dive tours, deep-sea fishing, glass-bottom boat cruises but along this hilly stretch of coast, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more likely to hear the cicadas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concert than anything loud and late. [...] Trinidad is beloved for its iconic carnival, but sister island Tobago is often overlooked. This less-traveled paradise is a must for bird-watchers. Tobago has one of the highest densities of bird species in the world, with more than 200 varieties.

It is paradise. No hurries, no worries, just relax \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no wonder around 30 million people a year head to the Caribbean for a respite.\n\nWhile the [Dominican Republic](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/dominican-republic), [Jamaica](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica), [Puerto Rico](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/puerto-rico), and [the Bahamas](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas) are hot spots, the Caribbean is also home to locales without hordes of tourists and some where there is more wildlife than people. So, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the mood for the beauty without the bustle, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where to go.\n\n## 1. Kamalame Cay, the Bahamas\n\n**Best for a luxurious private island getaway**\n\nSome things are worth waiting for. Get to [Nassau](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas/new-providence/nassau), hop on a commuter flight, take a cab to the dock and board a water taxi that takes you to [Kamalame Cay,](https://www.kamalame.com/) a private island in Andros in [the Bahamas](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas/). The resort is near the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-largest barrier reef with acres of coconut palm groves and vegetation that competes with the bluest sea for what is most awesome.\n\nIf you want an island escape, this might just be it. The bungalows, villas, cottages, and beach houses are spread out for miles. Wheel around in your golf cart on white sand roads and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly you and Mother Nature with just enough people to have a little atmosphere. Activities include everything from deep-sea fishing and kayaking to playing tennis and cycling. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in chill mode, watch a movie at the alfresco cinema, climb in a hammock along the beach or head to the Bahamas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 only overwater spa. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also in good hands at the Great House restaurant, where the conch fritters, Asian barbecue spareribs, and the coconut green vegetable curry are crowd-pleasers.\n\nMake sure you venture back to Andros, with its underwater cave systems and the highest concentration of blue holes in the world. One of the most popular is Captain Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blue Hole in [Blue Holes National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas/north-central-andros/attractions/blue-holes-national-park/a/poi-sig/1555378/1332437). After a short drive, make your way through the pine forest, get up your nerve and jump from the platform into the fresh water. For a quieter experience, head to the [Androsia Batik Factory](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/the-bahamas/north-central-andros/attractions/androsia-ltd/a/poi-sig/1393989/1332437) where you can learn about the art of batik-making and try your hand at it.\n\n![A lush green coastline with a small village of houses](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2022-12/Jamaica-iStock-1000710180-RFC.jpeg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 2. Bluefields, Jamaica\n\n**Best for solitude**\n\nWhen you think Jamaica, [Montego Bay](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica/montego-bay) and [Negril](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica/negril-and-the-west/negril) probably come to mind. Skip the masses and head to Bluefields on the south coast instead. You can still arrange dive tours, deep-sea fishing, glass-bottom boat cruises but along this hilly stretch of coast, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re more likely to hear the cicadas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concert than anything loud and late.\n\nWhile you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the area, take a tour of the [Bluefields Organic Fruit Farm](https://www.facebook.com/bluefieldsorganicfruitfarmtours/?ref=br_rs) where you'll learn a bit about organic farming and Jamaican agricultural history. Decide which island treats \u00e2\u0080\u0093 perhaps coconuts, pineapples, naseberries, avocados, gineps, star apples or garden cherries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you want to take back to your hotel or the beach to enjoy.\n\nAlso nearby in Belmont Falls in a small yard off the main road is the monument that pays tribute to reggae legend Peter Tosh who spent his early years there. Tosh, one of the original Wailers, in reggae music history is not far behind icon Bob Marley. For an authentic Jamaican experience, mix it up with locals at [Bluefields Beach Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/jamaica/bluefields-belmont/attractions/bluefields-beach-park/a/poi-sig/1424487/1332805) where, at the weekends, families will be picnicking and the reggae music will be blasting.\n\n**Planning tip:** If after all that peace and solitude you want to liven things up a little, Negril is an hour away. Here you'll find hipster haunts like Rick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Caf\u00c3\u00a9 where you can dance and watch folks jump from cliffs into the sea.\n\n## 3. South Caicos, Turks and Caicos\n\n**Best for finding your zen**\n\n[Providenciales](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turks-and-caicos/caicos-islands/providenciales) gets all the glory, but [South Caicos](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turks-and-caicos) is a Caribbean gem worth your time. Fly into Providenciales and take a 30-minute flight to South Caicos. Location is everything. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look for bars and mega resorts, but wild donkeys and salt flats with pink flamingos.\n\nLet nature soothe your soul. There are two beaches here with possible dolphin- and humpback whale-sightings. Visit Iguana Island and the aquarium, a protected reef ideal for snorkeling, and get a glimpse of local life in old town Cockburn. For fun and fantastic food, make your way to Triple J\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, a backyard barbecue restaurant only open on the weekends. It's a friendly spot where the music is pumping. Fill up on jerk pork, chicken, ribs, grilled lobster, fish and conch, and of course peas and rice.\n\nTake an excursion to Long Cay, part of the Admiral Cockburn Land and Sea National Park, a protected area full of ospreys, egrets, herons and more. Long Cay is also where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find tons of Rock Iguanas. South Caicos is typically pretty windy and there are many flat water and bay kiting locations, so kiteboarders will have plenty of reasons to be psyched.\n\n**Planning tip:** Consider spending a day in Providenciales. There are new hot spots like the [BLT Steakhouse](https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/caribbean/turks-and-caicos/dining) at the Ritz-Carlton and the uber-luxe [MRVL Spa](https://www.mrvlspa.com/) for next-level pampering.\n\n![Scuba divers in full gear head down stairs towards a beach for a shore dive](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2022-12/Bonaire-iStock-1170310192-RFE.jpeg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 4. Bonaire\n\n**Best for diving**\n\n[Bonaire](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/bonaire), one of the ABC islands ([Aruba](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/aruba), Bonaire and [Cura\u00c3\u00a7ao](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/curacao)), doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the buzz of the other two. But divers know this part of the Dutch Caribbean is where the action is, with nearly 90 dive sites, coral reefs, and sea caves. Iguanas, parrots, and other critters call Bonaire home, and [Gotomeer](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/bonaire/north-of-kralendijk/attractions/gotomeer/a/poi-sig/1549190/1330986) is a saltwater lagoon on the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northern end where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see flamingos.\n\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fun to be had at [Washington-Slagbaai National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/aruba-bonaire-and-curacao/bonaire/north-of-kralendijk/attractions/washington-slagbaai-national-park/a/poi-sig/365861/1330986), be it hiking to the tallest peak at Mt Brandaris, cliff-jumping into turquoise waters at Boka Slagbaii or chilling in the tide pool at Boka Kokolishi. Windsurf and kayak through mangroves. For a unique golfing experience, play on Bonaire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s natural golf desert course (where wild goats and donkeys roam). When hunger calls, you can find everything from a food truck on the beach to fine dining in Sebastian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\n## 5. Nevis, St Kitts and Nevis\n\n**Best for hikers**\n\n[Nevis](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-and-nevis/nevis), in the Leeward Islands, is one of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best kept secrets. The smaller of the dual-island nation of [St Kitts and Nevis](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-and-nevis), its mystique is the inactive volcano, mountains, often shrouded in mist, and the Nevis Peak at more than 975m (3200ft). The beaches are beautiful and uncrowded where wild donkeys, goats, and green vervet monkeys roam. Take an adventurous climb up Mt Nevis or a less intense hike to rainforest waterfalls.\n\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss [the Botanical Gardens of Nevis](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-nevis/south-nevis/attractions/botanical-gardens-of-nevis/a/poi-sig/1055861/1005470), home to tropical plants from around the world and stunning artwork. The [Nevis Equestrian Centre](https://www.nevishorseback.com/) offers rides that include beaches, trails, and villages. The fishing is good in these parts too, where barracuda, sailfish, and blue marlin are plentiful.\n\nDine at The Rocks that sits 300m (1000ft) above sea level on the grounds of the [Golden Rock Inn](https://www.goldenrocknevis.com/), where you can enjoy magnificent sea views, cascading ponds, and lush gardens. For a history lesson, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hamilton House, the Georgian style building in Charlestown where Alexander Hamilton was born and raised, now the [Museum of Nevis History](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-and-nevis/nevis/charlestown/attractions/museum-of-nevis-history/a/poi-sig/1396674/358150).\n\nConsider staying at the [Four Seasons Resort](https://www.fourseasons.com/nevis/) on Pinney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Beach. Sit seaside, nestled by rocks watching the sunset at the resort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mango restaurant. Another good choice is [The Hermitage](https://hermitagenevis.com/) at the foot of a rainforest covered mountain.\n\n**Planning tip:** Spend a day on the sister island of St Kitts where you can hike Mt Liamuiga Volcano and check out [Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-kitts-nevis/northern-st-kitts/attractions/brimstone-hill-fortress-national-park/a/poi-sig/1396637/1331211).\n\n![A woman stands on a board walk that cuts through a dense rainforest landscape](https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2022-12/Dominica-iStock-82068128-RFC.jpeg?auto=format,compress&q=72&fit=crop)\n\n## 6. Dominica\n\n**Best for nature lovers**\n\nNot to be confused with the Dominican Republic, [Dominica](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/dominica) is one of the most unique Caribbean islands. Nicknamed \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe nature island of the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the thrills are loggerhead turtles, whales, hot springs, boiling lakes, mountains, waterfalls, and black sand beaches.\n\n[Morne Trois Pitons National Park](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/814/) is a national treasure with spots like [Trafalgar Falls](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/dominica/trafalgar-falls/attractions/trafalgar-falls/a/poi-sig/1020530/358046). Morne Trois Pitons is an active volcano, one of nine in Dominica. Trek the park\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trails with views of mountains and the rainforest. Kayak and snorkel in [Soufriere-Scott\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Head Marine Reserve](https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/6022/). For a wellness themed retreat there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s [Jungle Bay](https://www.junglebaydominica.com/caribbean-islands-packages?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyracBhDoARIsACGFcS63KJ_Yna0bdZYytZ9EtH2nBJCEU4ycyY5c1Q4l0_BsxaH9YJ2rqfcaArRREALw_wcB) on nearly 20 acres of lush landscape. Revitalize yourself at the Bamboo Spa with the signature Jungle Bay Massage with coconut, castor and bay essential oils.\n\n**Planning tip:** Have the concierge hook you up with a local guide. Dominica has many nooks and crannies you might not discover on your own.\n\n## 7. Tobago\n\n**Best for bird-watchers**\n\n[Trinidad](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/trinidad-and-tobago/trinidad) is beloved for its iconic carnival, but sister island [Tobago](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/trinidad-and-tobago/tobago) is often overlooked. This less-traveled paradise is a must for bird-watchers. Tobago has one of the highest densities of bird species in the world, with more than 200 varieties. Tobago\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Unesco World Heritage Site, [Main Ridge Forest Reserve](https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5646/) is the oldest protected forest in the western hemisphere, with nine trails to keep hikers happy.\n\nYou'll hear great music in the birthplace of the steel pan drum. Soak up the sounds on a Sunday night at the legendary street party, [Buccoo Sunday School](http://www.buccoo.net/treasures/buccoo-sunday-school) in Buccoo. Those with a sweet tooth might want to book a tour of the [Tobago Cocoa Estate](https://www.tobagococoa.com/). The island's best beaches include Buccoo Bay and Englishman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bay, or cool off with a bold jump into Argyle Falls, Tobago\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest waterfall.\n\n## 8. Canouan, St Vincent and the Grenadines\n\n**Best for turtle lovers**\n\nHere, tortoises outnumber people. What you will find plenty of on this 3.5-mile island in [St Vincent and the Grenadines](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/st-vincent-and-the-grenadines), is boats, incredible ones at the [Sandy Lane Yacht Club](https://slycr.com/berthing/). Canouan has bragging rights for being surrounded by the Caribbean\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest living coral reef and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good fly-fishing and kitesurfing here too. Check into the [Mandarin Oriental, Canouan](https://www.mandarinoriental.com/en/canouan/caribbean) and you may feel like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a private-island sanctuary, a secret escape, with just 26 suites and 13 villas on the 1200-acre estate that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on Godahl Beach. Spend time on the 18-hole golf course or relaxing in the spa. Snorkeling in lagoons and hiking up Mt. Royal make for more fun.\n\n**Planning tip:** The Mandarin has a six-seat resort jet that can be booked as a shared or private charter from Barbados, St Lucia, Grenada, Martinique, and St Vincent airports.\n\nFor Explorers Everywhere\n\n### Follow us\n\n### SUBSCRIBE\n\n### Get 20% off your first order.\n\nSubscribe to Lonely Planet newsletters and promotions.

unforgettable experience and a true highlight of our latest Vancity Adventure. Exploring the historic prison with my son brought history to life in such a powerful way. The audio tour was incredibly well done\u2014walking through the actual cells while hearing the stories of the inmates and guards was both eerie and fascinating.\n\nThe ferry ride offered stunning views of San Francisco and really set the tone for the experience. Alcatraz is a must-visit for anyone who loves history, mystery, or just a unique family adventure. Another incredible stop on our journey together!\n\nFollow more of our father-son travels at Vancity Adventure \u2014 where every trip has a story.

We've been to US Orlando several times and love it! We believe Express Passes are worth their weight in gold and we're always there for Early Entry.\n\nWe parked around 7:15 and got through security and were lined up for the gates around 7:30. They opened the gates and let us go to the rope. At 7:45 they physically walked us down in an orderly fashion to Mario World. They clearly have it dialed because we walked in just at 8am! At 8:01 we were walking into Mario Kart.\n\nThe theming of Mario World is really well done and so is the queue for Mario Kart, but the ride itself isn\u2019t the blockbuster I expected. I really thought it would be a live action Mario Kart where we got to drive. Nah\u2026 You rode on a track system and have augmented reality visor on so you can see the other cars/characters and shoot them with shells and stuff. It was cool, but nothing that I\u2019d go through the hassle of EA for again. We checked out the side games before the got slammed and they all had a small wait and most of them were pretty lame really. The 2 that were fun were the ones where you had to change all the colors to make them the same before time ran out. And we didn\u2019t get the wristbands, so our scores meant nothing and we couldn\u2019t even play the Bowser challenge which is apparently the best one. Oh well. \n\nWe left Mario world just after 9 and went straight to Revenge of the Mummy. We beat the crowd there so we didn\u2019t have to use our EPs. It was a fun ride, and I\u2019d say scarier than the one in Orlando, but it was shorter and didn\u2019t have the effects or the \u201cBrendan Fraser\u201d magic that Orlando has. Transformers was closed, so we hit Jurassic World next. This was the same ride as Orlando, but themed as Jurassic World, so it had Owen and the Indominus Rex and it was really well done. We also got pretty wet on the drops. I\u2019d give the edge to this one over Orlando! \n\nWe were done with the Lower Lot, so we went back up the escalators, stopping to get some pics of the city along the way (the famous smog was out today). We started with the Simpsons Ride and the wait time was like 45 min so we just used the EP. It still takes along time to ride thanks to all the pre shows. It was the exact same as Orlando. Done and done. \n\nWe were ahead of schedule, so we decided to do the Studio Tour now. We got onto the cart train and waited for the tour to start. It was actually a really nice tour and I appreciated not having to walk! The tour lasted 50 minutes or so and we saw lots of cool stuff. The highlights were the earthquake/flood, Kong 360, Jaws, Psycho (the live actor just made it) and Hill Valley and the clock tower from Back to the Future! It was a really cool tour, I\u2019d give it the edge over the Warner Bros. myself.\n\nAfter the tour, it was almost 11:30 so we made our way to Three Broomsticks for lunch. Luckily it wasn\u2019t too crowded yet. We ordered BBQ ribs, shepherds pie, fish n chips and mac n cheese to share. We also got butterbeer and a fishy green ale that was very good (and had boba). Everything was pretty good and then we wandered over to Forbidden Journey. We used our EP so we didn\u2019t get to experience all of the queue, but it looked the same as Orlando. The ride was exactly the same, but that was ok because its such a great ride! Flight of the Hippogriff was right there and the girls wanted to do it, so we rode it (all 30 seconds of it)! That was short, even shorter than Orlando. \n\nWe were done with the rides in Hogsmeade, so we let the girls get their wands out and do some magic. They had fun with the ones they could get to work, but not all them did. We got them more butterbeer as they walked around. Once they were done, we went on to do Despicable Me.\n\nLike Simpsons, this ride just takes forever because of all of the pre shows. So even with the EP it takes 20 minutes. It was the same as Orlando, and this one just isn\u2019t my favorite. We did Secret Life of Pets next. This one was new for me so I was kind of excited for it. But it was pretty lame. Just a slow track ride through different scenes of the movie (which I haven\u2019t seen). But the lamest \u201cride\u201d of the day was Kung Fu Panda. Just a 3D/4D show that was pretty boring.\n\nWe had done it all already, but we decided to go back to the lower lot and reride Mummy with our EP. We rode it again and it\u2019s the best ride at US Hollywood (if you don\u2019t count the studio tour). Now the girls wanted to reride Jurassic World. As we were on the ride, they put away the stegosaurus and brought out Blue. I thought for sure my kids would want to see Blue, but they didn\u2019t really care. I watched it a bit from a platform as we were heading back up. \n\nWe thought about sticking around for the Waterworld show, but it wasn\u2019t til 4 and it wasn\u2019t even 3 yet so we took off. We hit the store on the way out and they had some really cool autographed stuff in there, but we didn\u2019t buy anything. Then we left the park and hit City Walk. \n\nEverything I read about US Hollywood was basically true. Mario World is very well done. The ride is cool, but not a blockbuster. The best thing about the park is the studio tour. The best coaster is Revenge of the Mummy and the best ride is Forbidden Journey. We enjoyed the park, but it is much smaller, and much less of a \"thrill\" park than US Orlando.

W/ our WILDLIFE PROTECTOR Membership, we got 10% OFF.\n\nAs we were renting it, we saw the SD Zoo STAFF, release the morning MACAW. We don't see that very often!!!\n\nWe then got Gonzalo's coffee and my Diet Coke, TO START THE DAY!!!\n\nIt was then off to the GUIDED BUS TOUR. We had a great guide, his name was BEAU. He took us on a 35 to 40 Minute Tour, around the Zoo, up and down, here and there, backwards and forwards. EVERYWHERE!!!\n\nWe saw all of the animals there were to see, even the Polar Bears; who playing in the mud.\n\nIf you're coming to the SD Zoo for the first time, or are a long time member, MAKE SURE TO MAKE THE BUS TOUR THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOU COME!!!\n\nAfter the Bus Tour, we went to the Giraffes. While we were looking at them, we noticed that the someone special decided to make an appearance right across the street.\n\nTHE ELUSIVE RHINO!!! It was utterly amazing to see him, as we never see him.\n\nWe then just proceeded to make our way through the rest of the SD Zoo.\n\nWe jumped onto the SKYFARI, and that was great. It was right at 12:00 NOON. It was nice because we heard the ringing of the bells.\n\nWE COULD SEE FOREVER!!!\n\nI WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PANDA EXHIBIT, not well organized for people with disabilities, walkers, canes, OR scooters!!!\n\nWe had to pass on that one, which was fine. MUCH MORE TO DO.\n\nWe were at the bottom of the hill at that point, and so were able to ride up to beautiful elevators to the top, TO THE BRIDGE.\n\nI finished with some pictures of myself and KING TUT and the GORILLA HEAD.\n\nI also had a delicious vanilla ice cream cone!!!

The timing was perfect, as we arrived just as the sun was setting, offering breathtaking views of LA.\n\nWe headed to the rooftop and followed the signs for the telescope. Inside one of the domes there stood a huge telescope, the 2nd internal door was locked but the sign confirmed it would open at 7 pm. It was only 6:30 pm, and we were the only ones there, so we decided to wait. \n\nAbout ten minutes later, a queue began to form behind us. A woman started making rude comments about us \"pushing in,\" claiming they had been waiting for hours. However, there was absolutely no queue when we arrived. Perhaps queueing works differently in the US?\n\nAt 7pm the door opened into the room with the telescope and we were first to take a look. Through the telescope, we saw the Orion Nebula, a stunning display of fiery clouds and bright stars. It was truly beautiful. We then rushed back to the car, realizing we had only paid for an hour of parking and couldn't extend it. Thankfully, being first in line for the telescope paid off!

However to visit the bridge you have to be adult or older child and not be bothered by confined places and be able to climb ladders. They have a cafe on board and a gift shop. You get a small recorder type thing when you board and then to scan it at each point and listen to the stories and explanations. All sorts of plans are in the upper deck you can climb in some of them such as the helicopters. Many retired servicemen on board to chat with and answer questions.

I probably spent more time outside than inside the galleries. I took 3 tours ... architecture, gallery (in depth on a few pieces of art), and the Medieval Manuscripts. All fascinating with knowledgeable volunteer docents. The Getty Center is free ... but there's a charge to park. I spent about 4 hours there. Barely scratched the surface. I brought my lunch and there were lots of places to picnic. There's tram from the check in to the galleries ... you can walk but it's probably more fun to take the tram.

That means early entry for those staying onsite is FAR MORE EXCLUSIVE than early entry at WDW. Take advantage of it and stay at 1 of the 3 DL resorts. Yes, plenty of \"nicer\" or \"cheaper\" hotels are also just a stone throw away from DL, but early entry is critical to minimizing wait times.\n\n2) Rope Drop - If you're ontime for rope drop, you're late! To beat the crowds, you have to be at the front of the pack, meaning you're close to the gates when the park opens. To do that, you have to be at security before it opens, which means you have to be up EARLY. We were up at 5:45 for a 7:30 EA. If you show up at the gate at 7:30, it's going to take you 20+ minutes just to get through the gate! Be sure to make full use of the morning BEFORE the crowds arrive.\n\n3) Lightning Lane Multi Pass - It's pricey because it's worth it. Simple as that. You can reminisce about the good ol' days when FastPass was free and Disney didn't seem to be a remorseless profit machine all you want, but those days are gone forever. ADAPT. I was amazed at how much shorter the LL lines were for DL compared to WDW. AT WDW, you could count on a 15-20 min wait IN THE LLs. At DL, the most we waited for a LL was 10 min and that was for Star Tours (on account of the pre-show, etc.)\n\n4) Technology - Download the Disneyland App and learn how to use it to its full potential BEFORE you leave. Learn how to play the LL game. If you don't know what that means, google it. Because we know how to \"play\" the LL game, we waited for maybe 5-6 rides in 2 days. The rest of the 30+ rides we rode over 2 days were via LL. Our average wait time was probably less than 10 min. during a Spring Break week! Make sure your tickets are linked to your reservation, make sure your party is all connected. Learn how to use mobile order for dining. If you're just looking at wait times, you're not leveraging the app's capability. Yes, this does mean that you will have to be ON YOUR PHONE ALL DAY at the park.\n\n5) Park Hopper - Disneyland and California Adventure are so close to each other, you'd be crazy not to get park hopper tickets. I don't always get park hopper tickets for WDW because park hopping at WDW can mean an hour out of your day to travel to another park. At DL, you just walk out of 1 park and walk across the plaza to the other! No more than 10 minutes! It's so easy.\n\n6) Dining - Be on top of your 60 day ADR window if you want a prime reservation at Carthay Circle Lounge or Trader Sam's. If you plan to eat at QS restaurants, DINE EARLY. We waited less than 5 min to get our food at Tiana's Palace because we ate at 11am. We ate dinner around 5. SHARE MEALS. Portions are huge at Disney! For our family of 5, we'd order 3-4 things for the table and share... It was always more than enough food.\n\n7) Have a plan - It always mystifies me when I see a review or somebody complains that they spent all this money to go to Disney and it was \"too crowded\" or \"lines were SO long\" or \"we ONLY got to ride like 4 rides all day\". Clearly, these people showed up to the park late, didn't have LLMP and had no idea how to go about their day at the park. PLAN! Figure out what you want to do and google some touring plans online. They work! We rode all of the rides we wanted to - at both parks, some multiple times in just 2 days (not even full days).\n\n8) Be ready to walk - For me, a full day at a theme park is a 30K+ step day. I can be on my feet walking all day. If that's not you, thats ok... You just need to plan and prepare accordingly. Work in breaks, do what's right for you. But make no mistake about it, theme parks are going to put your feet through the ringer. If you're going with Grandma/Grandpa make sure you take into account their fitness/ability to move. Parks are becoming filled with strollers and rascal scooters for this very reason.\n\n9) Expect to spend BIG $$$s - Disney is expensive, the hotels are expensive, flights to CA were expensive. MAKE A BUDGET. Be realistic about your budget - look up food prices, hotel prices, ticket prices. Have an idea of how much you wanna spend on the kiddos when they ask for snacks, stuffies, pins, souvenirs, t-shirts, toys, mickey ears and the like. If you're not careful about the TRUE COST of a disney vacation, it's very easy to sink into the rabbit hole.\n\n10) Rent DVC Points - We would never have ponied up for the rack rate at Grand California Hotel. We could afford it because we rented DVC points. Be prepared to book your resort 10-12 months in advance if you plan on renting points. There are lots of rental sites out there.\n\nBonus 11) Differences between WDW and DL - We're WDW pros. We've been there 6 times over the past 11-12 years. This was our first trip to Disneyland. If that's you, here are some key differences I noticed:\n\n1) WDW is MUCH bigger. 4 parks+2 water parks at WDW compared to DL/CA.\n\n2) DL has far FEWER hotels. Pixar Place - budget, Disneyland Hotel - moderate, GCH - deluxe\n\n3) Rides unique to Disneyland: The standouts were - Matterhorn, Nemo Submarines, The 4 FantasyLand dark rides\n\n4) Rides that are better than their WDW counterparts: Haunted Mansion, PotC, Indiana Jones Adventure\n\n5) Rides unique to CA: WebSlingers, Incredicoaster and Monsters Inc.\n\n6) Rides at CA that are better than their WDW counterparts: Radiator Springs Racers and Guardians of the Galaxy\n\n7) Downtown Disney is much smaller (and less fun to hang out in) than Disney Springs at WDW\n\n8) LL Lines are MUCH shorter at DL than WDW. The max we waited in a LL was 10 min - absolutely blew me away!!\n\nHappy Planning!

I didn\u2019t realize the inside rotated the entire time, but it was nice to see the view. At the top of the mountain, there were a few trails to walk, places to eat, and scenic viewpoints. We did the nature trail loop which was just under a mile. It was pretty flat, aside from the steep ramps to get to the path. It\u2019s definitely chilly, but it\u2019s great to see!

Our tour was scheduled for 2PM but we arrived shortly after 1PM. The gates to the park didn't open until 1:30PM, so we had to wait in our car on the street. Parking is a bit problematic, but managable. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. The weather was very hot and humid so it was necessary to drink a lot of water. The animals, while in cages, were easily visible but, because of the heat, somewhat lethargic. We highly recommend a visit to this park, hopefully during cooler weather, I'd like to give a special shout out to Bill who drove a cart for handicapped personnel and fed the animals.

Doug did an excellent job explaining each rum, the process to make it, and the difference between it and more known competitors. These rums(and their bourbon) were high on our scale. Natural ingredients and processed to accentuate the qualities of rum made them some of the best rums we have ever tasted. Highly recommend this tour for all!
